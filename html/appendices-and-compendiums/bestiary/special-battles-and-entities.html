<h5>Enemy Attacks</h5>
<p>Common folk have given these three sisters the names Weavess, Brewess, and Whispess, and call the whole threesome “The Ladies of the Wood,” or simply “The Good Ladies.” The Crones act as the true sovereigns of <a href="../../videos/treasure-hunts/velen.html" title="Velen">Velen</a>, whose inhabitants they help survive through harsh times in return for unquestioning obedience. They wield powerful magic, but one different from that of mages. They draw power from water and earth and are bound to the land in which they live. The Crones can hear everything that happens in their woods, predict the future, twist the threads of human lives and bring blessings as well as curses.</p>
<p>The Crones seem for all intents and purposes to be immortal. Magic elixirs keep them from aging and allow them to take the appearance of young women. These elixirs and their mystical ties to the swamps in which they live also give them supernatural strength and Vitality.</p>
<p>The Crones are the true rulers of <a href="../../videos/treasure-hunts/velen.html" title="Velen">Velen</a>, and are as powerful as they are wicked, warty, and hideous. In the aftermath of the assault on Kaer Mohren, Ciri and Geralt strike at the Crones in hopes of also reaching one of the Wild Hunt’s commanders, Imlerith.</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics: Ciri Versus The Crones</h5>
<p>The Fighting the three “Good Ladies” at once would be a tall order for Geralt. For Ciri, newly awakened to a portion of the powers she possesses, this is a good fight. Which is not to say that you can afford to be lax in your defenses.</p>
<p>Brewess, the large rotund Crone, should be Ciri’s first target. She’s the easiest target due to her size, and Ciri can easily evade her melee attacks while attacking relentlessly. You can also use Ciri’s teleport slashes to wreck havoc on all three Crones at once, but you will defeat them faster by focusing your melee attacks on one at a time, using a mix of fast and heavy attacks.</p>
<p>Whispess, the Crone with the red hood hanging over her face, will reach into the bloody water at her feet to throw the limbs of her unfortunate victims at Ciri. Watch out for this and teleport out of the way. Keep your eyes out of disturbances in the water, and avoid standing in them. They can also seemingly explode into a flock of crows that distract Ciri and interrupt her attacks, typically in response to damage they sustain.</p>
<p>For all their bluster, the greatest threat when dealing with the three Crones is overconfidence. They do hit fairly hard, if they are allowed to hit. Ciri’s speed and ability to teleport can make her safe from anything the Crones can throw at her. Stay on the offense, but not to such an extent that defense is neglected.</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics: Geralt Versus Weavess</h5>
<p>This optional battle occurs only during Epilogue: <a href="../../epilogue-and-endings/something-ends-something-begins-i/lament-for-a-slain-swallow.html" title="Something Ends, Something Begins (I)">Something Ends, Something Begins (I)</a> (see page 276) leading into slaying the last Crone.</p>
<p>Weavess is far from alone in this battle. Drowners are an almost constant presence, and will continue to arrive in support of Weavess. The fight also begins with a Grave Hag in the mix. Focus on slaying the other <a href="../../inventory-data/monsters.html" title="monsters">monsters</a> before focusing on Weavess. It helps to come into the fight with Necrophage oil already applied to your silver sword, if only to facilitate the prompt removal of Weavess’ allies.</p>
<p>Surprisingly fast on her feet, Weavess can quickly escape Geralt without resorting to teleportation. This also makes her a serious threat while Geralt fights off her Necrophage allies; she can and will use that distraction to flank the Witcher with powerful melee strikes. She can still use her teleport after taking damage, as she did during the battle against Ciri.</p>
<p>This fight can get chaotic very quickly if you do not eliminate the initial wave of <a href="./necrophages.html" title="Necrophages">Necrophages</a> early. Use Yrden to slow down the mob, and blast them with Igni to set them aflame. The time they spend burning is time they spend not moving or attacking Geralt. Tawny Owl is an excellent potion to use throughout this fight, as you will want to make as much use of <a href="../../training/combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> to keep things under control. Black Blood is a way to weaken the Drowners and hags that come to the Crone’s aid.</p>
<p>Igni is also useful against Weavess, even if she is not explicitly weak to its effects. Weavess will transform into a flock of crows to distract Geralt and escape his melee range. Use Moon Dust <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> on her to prevent this. Like the Drowners and Grave Hag that assist her, when on fire Weavess is temporarily disabled and you can score several free hits before she recovers.</p>
<p>Use <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> like Dancing Star or Grapeshot to clear the field of lesser creatures. Try to make sure you strike groups of targets with the <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a>, rather than wasting one bomb for one monster. The key to fighting Weavess in melee is to make good use of the dodge roll, rolling away from her attacks while still staying in range to exploit opportunities for strong attacks. If you have any strong, explosive crossbow <a href="../../inventory-data/bolts.html" title="bolts">bolts</a> to spare, now is an excellent time to make use of them.</p>
<p>So long as you remain calm, focus on preventing taking damage while maintaining pressure on Weavess, without losing control of the number of enemies that come to support her, vengeance will be yours. It’s a tall order to juggle all these factors at once.</p>

<h5>Enemy Attacks</h5>
<p>Aside from the differences mentioned below, treat Nithral as you would a particularly tough Wild Hunt Warrior (detailed previously in this <a href="./a-witchers-guide-to-killing-monsters.html" title="Bestiary">Bestiary</a> on page 718).</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics</h5>
<p>At first, Nithral takes on Geralt and Keira alone. His two-handed axe cannot be parried or countered; dodges and evasive rolls will keep you in one piece. The trick to beating Nithral is to bait him into attacking, dodging away from the attack, and striking with your sword. There is a rhythm to the fight, and if you get it right, between your sword and Keira’s magic, Nithral should not be able to touch you.</p>
<p>After sustaining enough damage, Nithral falls to his knees, summoning a protective shield, and calling forth a portal that summons hounds of the Wild Hunt. This is why it is important to apply the <a href="./elementa.html" title="Elementa">Elementa</a> oil! Quickly smash the hounds, the longer your take, the more Vitality Nithral restores while behind the shield!</p>
<p>Once the first wave of reinforcements is defeated, Nithral drops his protective energy shield to face you once again. Unfortunately for him, he hasn’t learned how not to fall prey to the previous strategy while behind the shield. Once you whittle down his Vitality once more, he summons the shield again, as well as another portal that sends more hounds after you.</p>
<p>This part of the fight can get difficult if you are reckless. Use Samum to blind the warriors, then flank and kill them. Be especially careful around the spear wielding foes, they have a reach advantage on Geralt. Throughout this fight, the Melt <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> ability that enhances Igni is invaluable. All Wild Hunt warriors and their commanders wear thick <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>, and being able to cut down their protection permanently can do wonders.</p>
<p>After the second wave of reinforcements is brought down, Nithral stands alone. Finish him off!</p>

<h5>Enemy Attacks</h5>
<p>Imlerith attacks with the following:</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">The Mace:</strong> Imlerith is a big and brutal warrior, relying on his physical strength and using magic only for short-range teleporting. His mace and shield give him a deadly combination of offensive and defensive prowess.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Heavy and Quick Combos:</strong> Despite his size, he can perform fast attacks chained into combos, often preceded by a teleport behind your back.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Ice <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>:</strong> Every time he teleports, ice <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> coats his form, offering extra protection from you.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">After Damage:</strong> Once he receives major damage, he changes his battle style, with vivid and rapid strikes; at this point dueling is impossible.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Weaknesses:</strong> Imlerith’s biggest shortfall is his vanity; he concentrates much more on impressive flourishes to his strikes than effectiveness. Many of his attacks leave him unguarded, or can be easily dodged. Though his shield gives him good protection, flank him from the left to reach his right arm and back, and push your attack through.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold"><a href="../../training/combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a>:</strong> Use quick Igni to melt his ice <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>, or channel Igni to allow you to better position yourself when Imlerith hides behind his shield. Yrden, Aard, and Axii aren’t very effective; use mostly Igni and Quen. Channel and also use quick Quen to increase your defense.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold"><a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="Bombs">Bombs</a>:</strong> Blind him for a moment with Samum <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a>, giving you extra time for positioning. Well-timed (and aimed) Dancing Stars or Grapeshots also work well to break a combo and deal damage.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Without a shield:</strong> When he drops his shield, concentrate on defending yourself. After a few charges, Imlerith gets exhausted, and this is the only time you are able to perform a counter-strike.</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics</h5>
<p>A reliance on specific abilities can help win this fight. For example, Fleet Footed skill mitigates damage if you’re struck while dodging. As usual, healing your wounds with Swallow or White Raffard’s Decoction is critical, as the attacks employed are especially damaging if they strike you.</p>
<p>A more advanced tactic, aside from employing Quen and darting in and out with sword strikes as the opportunities arise, is to use Thunderbolt and Tawny Oil interchangeably to maximize your effectiveness; you can cast Quen more often, and therefore have more occasions to utilize heavy attacks enhanced with Thunderbolt.</p>
<p>Samum <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> are also a great combo starter. When Imlerith is blinded, go behind and attack his back, channel Axii, and you have a few extra seconds before he can block your spell again. Also try to reduce the effectiveness of Imlerith’s teleportation by trying to jump into his direction, just as he begins to conjure the rift.</p>

<h5>Enemy Attacks</h5>
<p>Caranthir attacks with the following:</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Ice Lance (ranged):</strong> Caranthir fires singular <a href="../../inventory-data/bolts.html" title="bolts">bolts</a> of powerful ice magic in fairly quick succession at you. Roll to evade these targeted spells.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Ice Lance Barrage (ranged):</strong> These are conjured from a long distance. A few shards cast all at once, or a number one after another. When five lances of light are over his head, and after a short delay he fires them en masse at you. If you’re struck by this barrage, you’re partially frozen, slowing you down and making it harder to avoid other attacks.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Ice <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>:</strong> At close quarters, he casts a spell to toughen his <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> with ice. Melt it with Igni.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Teleportation:</strong> He also teleports to gain a better position on you, and after sustaining damage from you.

Work your way to Caranthir as quickly as possible to attack him, lest he teleports again. Striking him as he is preparing his ice <a href="../../inventory-data/bolts.html" title="bolts">bolts</a> will cancel his attacks.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Ice Elementals:</strong> At around half his vitality, he summons Ice Elementals to act as bodyguards. He is vulnerable during the summoning, so take that opportunity to hit him as much as possible before switching your focus to the Ice Elementals. Use Dimeritium <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="Bombs">Bombs</a> on the elementals to help weaken them (as well as specific tactics detailed in the Ice Elemental section of this <a href="./a-witchers-guide-to-killing-monsters.html" title="Bestiary">Bestiary</a>), but don’t forget that Caranthir is still firing his magic at you. You’ll have to be mindful of his attacks, while also dealing with the ice elementals own abilities. Try to get rid of the Elementals first before returning your attention to Caranthir (alternatively, keep away from them, and use them as cover so they absorb any ice shards). However, if you allow multiple Elementals to be summoned, it will be that much harder to address the sorcerer.</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics: Ciri versus Caranthir</h5>
<p>You are Ciri. There are two parts to this fight, beginning with Ciri. Caranthir attempts to engage in melee <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> against the swordswoman, but as you are by now very familiar with, she is incredibly skilled and powerful. Rush him down and slash away with her sword.</p>
<p>He teleports when he takes enough damage, usually far enough away from Ciri that she cannot reach him during her lunging sword strikes. You can either sprint over to him to continue the offensive, or use Ciri’s teleport slash to reach him even faster. Beware that Caranthir can also teleport directly behind Ciri for a surprise attack, but this can easily be countered with a fast attack or the teleport slash.</p>
<p>Once you deal enough damage to Caranthir as Ciri, she ends the spell Caranthir has been maintaining. After more drama unfolds, Geralt arrives to finish off the Wild Hunt sorcerer.</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics: Geralt versus Caranthir</h5>
<p>You are Geralt. At long range, dodge the ice shards Caranthir fires at you with easily sidesteps or rolls. Then close the gap between you and Caranthir by dashing forwards between his spells, rolling to the sides to avoid his quintet of icy orbs, or his single projectile thrusts. Use Fleet Footed Ability to avoid incoming damage. Time your rolls to occur just prior to the projectiles striking you. Make brief checks of your mini-map when Caranthir teleports, so you can quickly turn to face him.</p>
<p>Use Quen to ignore the multiple shards, and active Quen to absorb incoming shards (if they are coming one after another). Caranthir’s ice <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> can be melted with Igni; save your Stamina (or Adrenaline) so you can cast it.</p>
<p>When he reaches around half his health, he summons a great slab of ice, which transform into an Ice Elemental. With Igni, talent, good dodge timing, and positioning yourself away from Caranthir so his projectiles actually strike this golem (protecting you in the process!), you’re able to remove these threats. These Elementals can be kept alive, and used as cover from Caranthir’s ice shards. These foes are slow, so slash at them to increase your Adrenaline points.</p>
<p>Caranthir’s projectiles are supplemented by a trio of orbs, one after the other. Roll and dodge them, and when slicing at your foe, make only three or four strikes before backing off, or you may be caught after he teleports and launches projectiles at you.</p>
<p>At around 5-10 percent of his health, Caranthir likely summons another Ice Elemental. You may be tempted to ignore this foe and concentrate on killing Caranthir, which is a worthwhile plan, as long as you avoid the Elemental’s attacks, and a second elemental summoned shortly afterward.</p>
<p>This can be a punishing and long fight to deal with, so stay focused on limiting the amount of harm you can endure. Caranthir teleports as soon as you begin to deal damage, so use Thunderbolt and heavy attacks to maximize your effectiveness. Once you do manage to defeat Caranthir, he attempts one last suicidal attack on the Witcher, teleporting both of you into the waters beneath the ice. Swim for the surface as fast as you can to avoid drowning!</p>

<h5>Enemy Attacks</h5>
<p>Eredin attacks with the following:</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Sword Combinations (melee):</strong> He is adept at swordplay, enhanced by the Wild Hunt’s magic. He can perform long combos, block your attacks and <a href="../../training/combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a>, and can easily counter you and strike back viciously afterwards. These long combos are deadly, so hold your guard and wait for a good opportunity to strike.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Ice <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>:</strong> At close quarters, he casts a spell to toughen his <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> with ice. Melt it with Igni. Eredin can block your channeled Igni, but cannot perform any other action during this time, buying you some time to replenish your health with food or <a href="../../inventory-data/potions.html" title="potions">potions</a>. Use Yrden to weaken Eredin’s mobility.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Spells:</strong> On the cliff top arena, he uses three spells to defeat you: a single slashing wave of power, a multiple slash wave of power, and a rain of ice shards. Dodge Eredin’s spells with swift <a href="../../training/movement.html" title="movement">movement</a>, retreating, and Quen. The rain of shards is both chaotic and dangerous, so look for shadows of incoming shards and move away from them.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Teleports:</strong> He uses a short teleport to overpower your mobility. He gains ice <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> every time he employs this technique. Once damaged, he drags you through a portal to a large arena. When Eredin is low on health, he desperately casts rain of ice shards and escapes through the portal; waste no time following him, and dodging any last shards.</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics</h5>
<p>The battle against the Wild Hunt overlord begins with him taunting you. Take that time to duck into your items menu and use <a href="../../inventory-data/potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> that will help you stay in the fight. Tawny Oil, Swallow, and Full Moon are all good choices if you’ve made the higher quality brews. Blizzard is also a good potion for the fight. Eredin’s swordplay can be difficult to parry or counter-attack. Samum <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> are a low risk, high reward strategy; a well-timed throw lets you utilize a few extra attacks as Eredin staggers from the explosion.</p>
<p>The first phase of the fight can be very short, depending on your skill and your gear. Eredin hits quite hard even against a well-armored Witcher. Eredin’s defenses are quite stiff. Reckless attacking will only serve to get you killed when he inevitably counterattacks one of your swings. When he has his sword up in a defensive stance, he will block your attacks unless you manage to flank him.</p>
<p>Like Ciri, Eredin can teleport. He appears behind Geralt to try and score a fatal series of sword strikes. Roll away from him in those circumstances, it’s possible a simple dodge will not get you out of range.</p>
<p>Facing Eredin head on is a dangerous proposition. Not only is he a skilled defender with his sword, he is more than a match on the offense. His strikes come fast enough that it is almost completely unsafe to attempt heavy strikes unless it is after a counter-attack and he is temporarily off balance. If you cannot perform counters, parry or roll out of the way.</p>
<p>Look for him to raise his sword overhead with both hands. This attack cannot be parried or countered, only evaded. The attack comes quickly, and can be done in the middle of his sword combos, after a teleport, or after he counters Geralt.</p>
<p>The key to fighting Eredin, at any point in the battle, is to dodge or parry any melee attacks, while remaining close enough to score a heavy strike when the opening presents itself. This is a fight won by inches, blow by blow. Getting greedy can be extremely painful for you.</p>
<p>Watch out for him to try backhanding or kicking Geralt. These attacks cannot be parried or countered, and if they land will stun the Witcher long enough that he may not be able to roll or dodge the follow-up sword slashes.</p>
<p>After losing roughly a quarter of his Vitality, Eredin creates a portal and sends Geralt and himself to a clifftop arena. This marks the beginning of the second, and most difficult phase of the battle.</p>
<p>In addition to his melee prowess, Eredin gains several new attacks in this arena. The first is the ability to fire shockwaves from his sword. This is often telegraphed by him teleporting to a far point in the area, and holding his sword overhead. He fires one shockwave first, then three waves in a fan pattern, followed by five. It’s a simple matter of running around Eredin to evade the attack, but if you are too far away, the last set of shockwaves can be hard to evade. Use the delay between each attack to close in and score a hit.</p>
<p>After a teleport, Eredin can also call down a storm of ice-laden meteors. Stay on the move, and avoid the projected impact zones, appearing as a patch of ground glowing brighter that the rest. If you get hit, you will be partially frozen and move much slower, making it more likely that you suffer multiple hits. You can run up to Eredin while he channels this spell, and get him to hurt himself with the meteors for a good amount of damage. This immediately cancels the spell, and leaves him open for an attack.</p>
<p>His final new attack is the ability to summon magical spheres at Geralt’s feet, which explode after a short delay. As with the meteors, getting harmed by this will partially freeze Geralt and make him much slower on his feet. Keep moving, ideally towards Eredin, and land a heavy strike to cancel the spell.</p>
<p>After Eredin falls below a third of his total Vitality, he taunts Geralt again, and he becomes significantly more aggressive. Remain calm, and continue to concentrate on minimizing how much he hits you, while scoring hits whenever he presents the opportunity.</p>
<p>Just before defeat, Eredin will open a portal back to the ship the fight began on, presumably to try and leave Geralt stranded on the cliff top above the shores of the Marlin Coast. Follow the elf back through the portal, and finish him off!</p>
