<p>The classic tale of the Vampire involves an eternally-living creature disguised as an individual of refined breeding—one that seeks out its victims with the interest one would expect from a person of culture. They seduce their prey, drink their blood, and can transform into a bat. Effectively immortal, a Vampire can live for decades or centuries before they are detected, much less slain. For one type of Vampire all this holds true. For all others, they are <a href="../../inventory-data/monsters.html" title="monsters">monsters</a> like any other.</p>

<h5>Enemy Attacks</h5>
<p>Their greatest asset of an Alps and Bruxae is their agility: their leaps can appear to defy the laws of gravity. When in human form, they easily blend in with the surrounding community, which makes them very dangerous indeed.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">The Difference:</strong> Alps differ from Bruxae in that they do not emit a shrieking noise whose shock wave can incapacitate.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Supernatural Swiftness:</strong> In <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>, Alps and Bruxae display supernatural speed and incredible (even by Vampire standards) stamina. One must aim one’s sword with great precision, for Alps and Bruxae have mastered the art of dodging. Alps and Bruxae can also move and jump as if defying gravity. After this dashing hither and yon, expect the Alp or Bruxa to end with an attack. Swift reactions are needed to parry or counter this. Otherwise, dodge or roll.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Misty Teleport (ranged):</strong> The Alp or Bruxa quickly repositions herself, with only a small stripe of rippling air giving her position away. Continuously move until she makes an appearance, or risk being struck.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Jump Attack (ranged):</strong> As if defying gravity, the Alp or Bruxa launches forward, leaping quickly to melee range and sometimes ending with a strike or one of her two melee-based attacks. This can occur from any distance, so prepare to go from range to melee confrontations in the blink of an eye!</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Claw Attack (melee):</strong> Three regular melee attacks with claws raking your <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> and skin, these can be parried and countered; indeed, this is the only way you’ll cause a strike on an Alp or Bruxa under most circumstances.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Flurry Attack (melee):</strong> A sequence of five melee attacks, which occur in all directions. Difficult to parry and very difficult to counter, though try the latter if you wish to deal damage. Otherwise, dive away with a dodge or roll, or stand fast and parry.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Blood Drain:</strong> The Alp or Bruxa leaps on you, and tears at your throat. You’re helpless for a few moments before you throw off the assailant. This is the time when Black Blood potion proves useful, poisoning the Alp or Bruxa in return for her draining your blood. Otherwise, watch for her leap at mid to close range, and dodge it. After one of these foes is poisoned with Black Blood, expect <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> to slow down considerably.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Guttural Scream (Bruxae only):</strong> A terrible shriek with a power to split open barrels and loose scenery (like an Aard spell), as well as staggering and knocking you down with the blast if you’re caught in it. This attack is also used to break your guard if you’re constantly blocking. Listen and watch for the shockwave, rolling away before you’re caught.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Strengths:</strong> An Alp or Bruxa hits heavily and can stagger you. She also blocks attacks with both hands, including flank attacks, and is masterful at dodging and jumping.</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics</h5>
<p>Think of <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> with an Alp or Bruxa as you would a duel with a skilled human, gaunt and monstrous in appearance, with superhuman speed and strength. Alps and Bruxae are exceptional at defending themselves with dodging, parrying, or quick repositioning. Under most normal circumstances, you can only succeed in wounding an Alp or Bruxa after counterattacking. Perfect this to ensure you aren’t overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The Yrden Sign is recommended, Also makes her visible and disables their ability to teleport. Another strategy is to drink the Black Blood potion. Alps and Bruxae are vulnerable to the Moon Dust bomb, which does not make them completely visible, as it does in the case of other vampiric <a href="../../inventory-data/monsters.html" title="monsters">monsters</a>, but does make them far easier to track visually. Otherwise, you must rely primarily on countering an Alp’s or Bruxa’s attacks; she must be the aggressor, while you defend and slice when she claws at you. For this reason, Quen is an obvious help in absorbing one of her strikes, and can act as a counter, too.</p>

<h5>Vulnerable Against</h5>

<h5>Enemy Attacks</h5>
<p>Unlike their portrayals in ballads and legends, Ekimmaras look nothing like handsome, pale aristocrats with charming eastern accents, though, like Katakans or Nekurats, they do bear a strong resemblance to overgrown bats. They also do not suck blood from the necks of virgins with a delicate, kiss-like bite; they tear them to shreds using long, sharp claws and then slurp the splattered blood off the ground.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Ethereal Plane:</strong> Blinking out of existence, turning invisible and becoming shadow-like, before heading to your location and raking you with talon attacks, is a plan the Ekimmara is keen on. Use of magic to dissuade an Ekimmara from remaining unseen (such as Quen and Yrden’s magic trap) is a key benefit to preventing a battle turning to favor the enemy. You cannot strike the beast with swords until it is congealed.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Razor-Rip Talons:</strong> Ekimmaras are unusually cruel and exceptionally swift. They are able to quickly land blow after blow capable of smashing even the best Mahakaman-made <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> into tiny shards. They should be fought with a silver sword, and these talon attacks (which can ignore <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>) cannot be parried.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Regeneration:</strong> Remember that Ekimmaras can regenerate health over time. One should thus never attempt to tire them out or, gods forbid, wait for them to bleed to death. Instead, cut them down as quickly as possible and, if possible, burn the body to ash and scatter it to the four winds.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Strengths:</strong> Ekimmara claws cause bleeding and can pierce <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>. It is imperative your defenses are strong when facing this creature.</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics</h5>
<p>Ekimmaras are especially dangerous foes due to their ability to regenerate. They can even outlast the effects of your finest <a href="../../inventory-data/potions.html" title="potions">potions</a>. Black Blood <a href="../../inventory-data/potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> are an effective way to weaken an Ekimmara. If you are stricken by their claws, you bleed profusely. That blood can harm the Ekimmara and knock it back, allowing you a brief respite from its assault.</p>
<p>Dodging is essential when fighting Ekimmaras. Their claws cannot be parried, and even if Black Blood is an available Witcher brew, it is best to avoid being wounded altogether, if you can help it. Utilize the area in which you are fighting to your advantage, employing scenery and undulations in height to gain some distance between you and the relentless slaughter the Ekimmara is capable of.</p>
<p>More capable Witchers ensure that their defenses are strong before an Ekimmara fight: Choose Yrden (and in particular, the Magic Trap attribute) and lay these between you and the creature, forcing the Yrden <a href="../../inventory-data/glyphs.html" title="glyphs">glyphs</a> to crackle their magic and whittle down the Ekimmara’s health. Employ Devil’s Puffball <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> to inflict poison damage; anything to continuously chip away the Vampire’s health, so it cannot regenerate as quickly. Prevent damage to yourself by using Quen, and step in with a flurry of your own attacks as the beast reels from the electrical magic. Igni is also a key benefit; especially Firestream which you can focus all fire damage in a single spot (the Ekimmara’s hide, preferably).</p>

<h5>Vulnerable Against</h5>

<h5>Enemy Attacks</h5>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Fleders:</strong> These are classified as lesser Vampires. Though weaker than the rest of their ilk in every aspect from the physiomagic to the physiognomic, they should not be underestimated, for they are very, very dangerous. Compared to other Vampires, Fleders display meager intelligence, seen most clearly in the mindless rage which causes them to try with</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">all their might to attack and tear to shreds any weaker being.</strong></p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Protofleders:</strong> These glowing Fleders (that, aside from their hue, have the same taste for blood and attack patterns as their overworld counterparts) have never had significant contact with the outside world, having spent their entire time on our planet in the Unseen Elder’s cave, whose atmosphere is very similar to that of their home world.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">No Running. Only Jumping:</strong> Think of the Fleder as a variation of the Katakan, bred to physically destroy its opponent. When engaging these foes, understand that unlike Bruxae (or Katakans), Fleders (and Garkains) run; instead, they close distance by jumping at their victims. Their attacks are strong enough to stagger or knock down human sized enemies. Fleders are fully capable of fighting one on one with you, but are truly potent when part of a group of Fleders, or other Vampires.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Savage Claw Swipes (melee):</strong> Impossible to parry, delivering some nasty damage, and knocking you back, these swiping claws are simple, but savage. You are better to weave around the front of such a foe, attacking the flank. Retreating and darting in after a swipe is also possible. Otherwise, let the beast hit you, after supping on Black Blood, so your own bleeding causes the Vampire severe pain.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Charge:</strong> A quick darting scamper and dodging means the Fleder can see your bladed attacks and react to them; and this extremely quick charge can stagger you if it connects. Rolling and dodging prevents this.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Savage Pound and Pounce:</strong> A high leap into the air, and two claws pounding the ground as it connects near your vicinity, the shockwave of this pounce can knock you down. Watching the Fleder launching from the ground is the key to detecting this attack early enough so you can dodge it or absorb it with Quen.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Back and Forth (Counter):</strong> Don’t expect an easy fight, as the Fleder is adept at countering your blades, jumping back, and then leaping forward again and starting claw swipes. Therefore, your attacks must be minimal before retreating. Simply hammering blow after blow into a Fleder isn’t possible.</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics</h5>
<p>When fighting Fleders, it is best to take advantage of their particular method of <a href="../../training/movement.html" title="movement">movement</a>. These creatures do not run, but they do try to catch their prey and knock it over by leaping. Knowing this behavior, you can plan the fight appropriately and not let yourself be caught by surprise. Such planning involves dropping Yrden when the Fleder lands, so it is slowed (and zapped if Magic Trap is employed), and <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> or <a href="../../inventory-data/crossbows.html" title="crossbows">crossbows</a> poised to whittle down the Vampire’s vitality. Otherwise, treat a Fleder fight like that of a Katakan or Ekimmara, roasting the beast with Igni (Firestream), and dropping <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> that can cause continuous damage over time. One final option is Axii, stunning the Fleder for long enough to deliver some vicious blows of your own.</p>

<h3>TALES FROM THE CRYPT</h3>
<p class="Note">This entry is related to general information regarding Higher Vampires, rather than the potency and <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> prowess of named Higher Vampires; to whit, Dettlaff (whose aggressive behavior is studied on page 796 of this <a href="./a-witchers-guide-to-killing-monsters.html" title="Bestiary">Bestiary</a>).</p>

<h5>The Best Battle Tactics</h5>
<p>They not only resemble us in appearance, but also share our intelligence and behavioral patterns. This means they do not squat in distant forests or hide in the shadows. On the contrary, they are particularly fond of cities, where they live out deceivingly normal lives. An exceedingly rare opponent for a Witcher, higher Vampires possess nearly unmatched strength and intelligence among all foes one could face. When they are transformed into their bestial state, evasion is key to surviving the encounter, but this is made difficult due to their speed.</p>
<p>When transformed, Higher Vampires also favor striking while invisible, appearing only when they are an eyeblink away from sinking their claws into a victim. This makes Yrden absolutely vital both for revealing the Vampire, but also for keep it in place long enough to cut it down with a silver sword, ideally coated in Vampire oil. Igni is one of the few real weaknesses a higher Vampire possesses. Use it if you can, if it catches on fire it will be stunned for a brief moment.</p>
<p>Black Blood is useful—but comes with the obvious risk of allowing the Vampire to draw blood in the first place. Do not rely on it to save you. It is best to have Quen prepared to absorb a blow, then cast Yrden to keep the monster in place for your silver sword. Drink a Tawny Owl potion for faster Sign usage.</p>
<p>Once a higher Vampire transforms, all <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> techniques you developed when fighting Katakans (see page 758) should be employed.</p>

<h5>Enemy Attacks</h5>
<p>The Alpha Garkain is a particularly strong variant of the Garkain, but is otherwise identical to fight.</p>
<p>Garkains belong to the group of creatures known as Lesser Vampires. They often gather around themselves members of other subspecies of Lesser Vampires, acting in such situations as leaders of the pack. They are by and large unable to run, but can jump a great distance and often attack their prey in that way.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">No Running. Only Jumping:</strong> Think of the Garkain as a variation of the Katakan, bred to physically destroy its opponent. When engaging these foes, understand that unlike Bruxae, Fleders (and Garkains) don’t run, instead they close distance by jumping at their victims. Their attacks are strong enough to stagger or knock down human sized enemies. Garkains are fully capable of fighting one on one with you, but are truly potent when part of a group of Garkains, or other Vampires.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Savage Claw Swipes (melee):</strong> Impossible to parry, delivering some nasty damage, and knocking you back, these swiping claws are simple, but savage. You are better to weave around the front of such a foe, attacking the flank. Retreating and darting in after a swipe is also possible. Otherwise, let the beast hit you, after supping on Black Blood, so your own bleeding causes the Vampire severe pain.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Charge:</strong> A quick darting scamper and dodging means the Garkain can see your bladed attacks and react to them and this extremely quick charge can stagger you if it connects. Rolling and dodging prevents this.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Savage Pound and Pounce:</strong> A high leap into the air, and two claws pounding the ground as it connects near your vicinity, the shockwave of this pounce can knock you down. Watching the Garkain launching from the ground is the key to detecting this attack early enough so you can dodge it, or absorb it with Quen.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Back and Forth (Counter):</strong> Don’t expect an easy fight, as the Garkain is adept at countering your blades, jumping back, and then leaping forward again and starting claw swipes. Therefore, your attacks must be minimal before retreating. Simply hammering blow after blow into a Garkain isn’t possible.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Psychic Incapacitation:</strong> During <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>, they usually keep their distance from their foes, trying to incapacitate them using a blast of mental energy provoking visions that beguile and disorient. If you’re struck by this psychic attack, expect confusion and distorted vision. Confusion prevents using <a href="../../training/combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a>, using items, running, parrying and sword attacks. It should also be remembered that the Samum and Moon Dust</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold"><a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> are always effective weapons against any mental attacks. Otherwise, retreat swiftly so you are not incapacitated.</strong></p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics</h5>
<p>When coupled with Fleders, Garkains keep their distance and assault victims with psychic attacks while Fleders attack from close range. These brainwaves can cause you to be stunned, opening you up to attacks from the Garkain, or other Vampires in the vicinity. The area of effect attack has a large radius and long anticipation (allowing you to see the attack coming and react accordingly). In all other respects, treat <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> against a Garkain in the same way, and using the same techniques, that you used when fighting a Fleder (see that <a href="./a-witchers-guide-to-killing-monsters.html" title="Bestiary">Bestiary</a> entry, previously).</p>

<h5>Vulnerable Against</h5>

<h5>Enemy Attacks</h5>
<p>Katakans are invulnerable to steel, regenerate quickly, and demonstrate acute hearing.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Ethereal Plane:</strong> Blinking out of existence, turning invisible and becoming shadow-like, before heading to your location and raking you with talon attacks, is a plan the Katakan is keen on. Use of magic to dissuade a Katakan from remaining unseen (such as Quen and Yrden’s magic trap) is a key benefit to preventing a battle turning to favor the enemy. You cannot strike the beast with swords until it is congealed.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Razor-Rip Talons:</strong> Katakans are able to quickly land blow after blow. They should be fought with a silver sword, and these talon attacks (which have <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>-piercing tendencies) cannot be parried.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Regeneration:</strong> Remember that Katakans are able to regenerate health over time. One should thus never attempt to tire them out. Instead, cut them down as quickly as possible, and employ projectiles and sword play that can deal damage even after you break away from <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Strengths:</strong> Katakan claws cause bleeding and can pierce <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>. It is imperative your defenses are strong when facing this creature.</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics</h5>
<p>When fighting a Katakan one must pay particular attention to its shadow—often the only way to know its location. To even the odds one can temporarily immobilize Katakans using the Yrden sign, then seize that moment to attack with all one’s might, for there might not be another chance. Unfortunately, the legends are wrong and the sun’s rays do not turn Katakans to ash. They are vulnerable to sunlight, however, and when the sun stands at its zenith their regeneration is considerably slowed.</p>
<p>Katakans are notably smarter and more powerful than Ekimmaras. Their power only increases at night, and you should take additional precautions if you’re hunting one at those late hours. Alternatively, wait for daylight, so the Katakan’s natural regeneration is impaired. Yrden is one of the most valuable tools when hunting a Katakan, undoing its invisibility, allowing a Witcher to feed them a silver sword. Another way to draw out a Katakan from invisibility is through the use of Igni, and the <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> the beast is vulnerable to. In general, the tactics employed when facing an Ekimmara work well against these more imposing and quicker foes.</p>
