<p>Ranging from massive Cyclopses and Giants to the deceptive Nekker, the ogroid family of monster is surprisingly diverse, requiring a variety of tactics and approaches to fighting them. One aspect that ultimately defines the ogroids is their propensity for brute strength: Even the diminutive Nekkers can become terrifying forces of nature.</p>

<h5>Enemy Attacks</h5>
<p>As in the case of Giants, one can only guess at the strong and weak points of a Cyclops. Its heft alone precludes effective use of the Aard Sign, while its enormous physical strength would make its blows particularly deadly. Cyclopses are most likely vulnerable to ogroid oil. As <a href="../../inventory-data/monsters.html" title="monsters">monsters</a> with relatively well-developed minds, they might also fall under the influence of the Axii Sign.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Charge:</strong> Expect this colossus to charge forward at you, when it focuses on your presence. It usually attempts a subsequent attack afterward, from the list mentioned below. Take this time to survey the <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> ground, and prepare to maneuver around this behemoth, rather than stand in front of it.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Ground Pound:</strong> If a Cyclops raises both hands in the air, avoid being anywhere close to the front of it. The resulting ground-pound flattens even the toughest warriors. If you don’t fancy being prone and open to a bludgeoning from the ogroid’s fists, retreat immediately. Rolling away (which covers more distance than dodging) is the safest method.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">A Rough Landing:</strong> Cyclopses can also leap into the air, knocking over anyone or anything too close to where they land. React in the same way as you would when backing up from a ground pound.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Lumbering Swipes:</strong> The usual attacks to dart from, when this gigantic ogroid heads into your personal space, are swatting swipes from each hand, usually horizontally, that can easily stagger, stun, knock you over, and damage you severely. As parrying or blocking isn’t possible, nimble dodging maneuvers (to get around the flanks of the foe for retaliation) is the best course of action.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Strengths:</strong> The strongest Witchers cannot parry or block any punch or slap delivered by a Cyclops, and a mere hop backward may not be enough to stay out of reach. Roll to the side or behind a Cyclops to evade their attacks and reach their vulnerable flanks.</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics</h5>
<p>Cyclopses go where they want; even a Witcher should move to the side if a Cyclops is charging forward. Do not stand in one place when fighting a Cyclops. They rarely flinch from anything you inflict on them, so they keep trying to fight no matter how many cuts from a silver blade they take. However, getting close to a Cyclops is dangerous, but still a necessity for slaying one. The Yrden Sign can help you do more work every time you get within sword range of these <a href="../../inventory-data/monsters.html" title="monsters">monsters</a>. To protect yourself from the first swinging fist of a Cyclops, use Quen.</p>
<p>Axii can temporarily confuse a Cyclops, giving you time to recuperate while the creature rages at something else. You may also wish to begin your bout lobbing some <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> that have a high-damage strike (like grapeshot), as well as peppering the beast with crossbow <a href="../../inventory-data/bolts.html" title="bolts">bolts</a>; if you can wound one of these creatures before it gets too dangerously close to you, so much the better. Another action is to lob Northern Wind <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> to freeze the foe, then attempt a single, devastating Rend strong attack before the Cyclops thaws. This effectively nullifies all the Cyclops’ melee attacks, providing you have enough <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a>, and inflict enough damage with your sword.</p>

<h5>Enemy Attacks</h5>
<p>The Cloud Giant resembles a clumsy, overgrown human and appears to be capable of reason, though he says nothing and does not seem too interested in any other form of communication. He has learned to use his natural surroundings, meaning the cloud on which he lives, to aid him while fighting; he will jump inside the cloud and pop out in an entirely different place, surprising his opponent.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Weapon Swing:</strong> A medium-range weapon swing. Dodge or leap to the side, or back away to avoid being struck.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Weapon Overhead Smash:</strong> A medium-range weapon smash, dropping vertically. Highly damaging, so avoid it using dodges and retreating.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Kick, Stomp, and Swipe:</strong> The Cloud Giant sometimes kicks, stomps, or swipes with his left arm; both push you back, increasing the distance between you, allowing the Giant to be more effective with his weapon swings. Simply avoid these by dodging.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Charge Attack:</strong> If you’re at long range, the Cloud Giant occasionally attempts a charge to close the distance. If you’re caught, expect to be pushed back, and possibly sent tumbling over. Recover and retreat, or simply roll or dodge to the side to avoid it.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Whirlwind Attack:</strong> Occurring at both short and long distances, this is the Cloud Giant’s most severe series of strikes, so watch for him raising his weapon up to the side of the head before he spins around. If he connects, the damage is significant, and you’ll be sent flying. Parrying is not an option, but dodging (or letting Quen bear the brunt of this) is.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Cloud Teleport:</strong> Using his lair to the best of his advantage, he drops into a cloud, and a moment later, leaps back out and brings his mighty weapon slamming down with an overhead smash. React by dodging, while keeping an eye on where he leaps up from so you aren’t caught.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Resistances:</strong> The Cloud Giant is immune to most <a href="../../training/combat/signs.html" title="signs">signs</a> aside from Igni, and is particularly resistant to Axii.</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics</h5>
<p>Engage this behemoth in <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> amid the clouds. Syanna helps, but it still takes skill and cunning to vanquish this tough son of a wench, which hits pretty hard for an illusion. Use the techniques you attempted when you slew the Giant named Golyat while first adventuring in <a href="../places-of-power/toussaint.html" title="Toussaint">Toussaint</a> (the next <a href="./a-witchers-guide-to-killing-monsters.html" title="Bestiary">Bestiary</a> entry), or employ similar techniques to those when facing a Cyclops or the Ice Giant in Undvik.</p>
<p>To shorten <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> considerably, stay within the three piles of metal objects. As this battle takes place on a cloud, during a thunderstorm, these objects are frequently struck by lightning. The objects remain electrified afterward, so lure the Cloud Giant close to one of the metal piles still writhing with energy, and wait for the foe to make a giant swing, and a giant mistake! The Giant’s weapon strikes the metal, electrocuting the fool and allowing you to attack him for a few moments. Keep this up!</p>

<h5>Enemy Attacks</h5>
<p>Though he came across as a wild, unthinking beast, Golyat used simple tools and any item could turn into a deadly weapon in his powerful hands. When fighting Golyat wields a millstone, making his every blow truly crushing. This lumbering behemoth has the following attacks and maneuvers to be wary of:</p>
<p>Golyat uses a Giant mill wheel on a tree trunk to deliver massive bludgeoning damage in vertical pounds or massive horizontal sweeps. He loves to swing this weapon, smashing things all around. His attacks are far-reaching; he’s extremely aggressive and tends to keep moving toward you, mostly ignoring the three knights.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Weapon Swing:</strong> A medium-range weapon swing. Dodge or leap to the side, or back away to avoid being struck.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Weapon Overhead Smash:</strong> A medium-range weapon smash, dropping vertically. Highly damaging, so avoid by using dodges and retreating.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Kick, Stomp, and Swipe:</strong> Golyat sometimes kicks, stomps, or swipes with his left arm; both push you back, increasing the distance between you, allowing the Giant to be more effective with his weapon swings. Simply avoid these by dodging.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Charge Attack:</strong> If you’re at long range, Golyat occasionally attempts a charge to close the distance. If you’re caught, expect to be pushed back, and possibly sent tumbling over. Recover and retreat, or simply roll or dodge to the side to avoid it.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Whirlwind Attack:</strong> Occurring at both short and long distances, this is Golyat’s most severe series of strikes, so watch for him raising his weapon up to the side of the head before his spins around. Damage is significant, and you’re sent flying. Parrying is not an option, but dodging (or letting Quen bear the brunt of this) is.</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics</h5>
<p>Golyat moves like his Cyclops brethren, refraining from running or strafing, and utilizes lumbering strides in your general direction. He is also incredibly tough, requiring a lot of damage in order to topple over. Exhibit patience, and work with your new knight friends. Occasionally they prove most worthy at distracting Golyat, allowing you to get in strikes when he’s pre-occupied.</p>
<p>Otherwise, dart in with a strike once Golyat finishes one of his troublesome, and damaging swings, and is recovering in readiness for his next attack. Darting in, damaging, and retreating is the key. You need not worry about the knights’ health, so let them bear the brunt of this enemy.</p>
<p>Or just shoot Golyat in the head with a crossbow; aim for the eye and unlock a hidden Achievement.</p>

<h5>Enemy Attacks</h5>
<p>This powerful primeval monster draws strength from frosts, and can bind Sirens to its will. It treats victims cruelly, and is particularly fond of human flesh. It uses simple but devastating weapons made from items looted from the bodies (and ships) of those it has slaughtered. On the occasion you face this behemoth, it has a ship’s anchor attached to a huge rusty chain, which it uses for bludgeoning during the latter part of the fight.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Charge:</strong> Expect this frozen foe to charge at you when it focuses on your presence. It usually attempts a subsequent attack afterward, from the list mentioned below. Take this time to survey the <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> ground, and prepare to distract it while your friends attack, lob <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> before getting out of the way, or shoot crossbow <a href="../../inventory-data/bolts.html" title="bolts">bolts</a> until it is too dangerously close to you.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Ground Pound:</strong> If the Ice Giant raises both hands in the air, avoid being anywhere close to the front of it. The resulting ground-pound flattens even the toughest warriors. If you don’t fancy being prone and open to a bludgeoning from the ogroid’s fists, retreat immediately; rolling away (which covers more distance than dodging) is the safest method.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">A Rough Landing:</strong> The Ice Giant can also leap into the air, knocking over anyone or anything too close to where it lands. React the same way as you would when backing up from a ground pound.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Lumbering Swipes:</strong> The usual attacks to dart from, when this gigantic ogroid heads into melee range, are protracted swipes from each hand, usually horizontally, that can easily stagger, stun, knock you over, and damage you severely. As parrying or blocking isn’t possible, nimble dodging maneuvers (to get around the flanks of the foe for retaliation) are the best course of action. Activate Quen so the first of these swats is shrugged off.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Anchors Away:</strong> A long-range weapon swing. Dodge or leap to the side (rolling is another fine option), or back away to avoid being struck. Employ Quen before the battle so the damage from the crushing anchor, if it hits you, is absorbed.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Strengths:</strong> The strongest Witchers cannot parry or block any punch or slap delivered by this Ice Giant, and a mere hop backward may not be enough to stay out of reach. Roll to the side or behind him to evade his attacks, and help your fellow Skelligers by constantly maneuvering so the beast has no single victim to crush.</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics</h5>
<p>Though similar to the Cyclops in terms of <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> ability, there is one aspect of the Ice Giant that must be cautioned; reportedly the monster draws its strength from cold weather with blizzards allowing them to reach their physical peak.</p>
<p>Creatures such as the Siren can be bound to the will of an Ice Giant. Witchers should coat their silver swords in oil that affect any potential allies to the Ice Giant to help eliminate them more quickly. A Hornwall Horn was once crafted to help repel Sirens attacking Skelligers, knocking them out of the sky with a single blast of noise. Having the horn is of great use against an Ice Giant, directing them to attack its enemies.</p>
<p>As with a Cyclops, evasiveness and footwork are your best defenses against an Ice Giant. Use Yrden to improve your chances of avoiding any attacks! The initial battle is similar to that of a Cyclops; use <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> or crossbow attacks to soften up the Ice Giant, then use Quen to protect yourself and make consistent and rapid dodges and rolls to avoid those swiping hands.</p>
<p>When the huge anchor is used by the Ice Giant, it becomes slightly less mobile, allowing you to launch sword strikes, or <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> like dancing star, or Igni that can damage this ice-loving foe. You can cunningly step forward, in front of the collision spot where the anchor hits the ground, and launch Igni (or Yrden), or lob <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> while the Giant struggles to haul the anchor back in for another swing. Repeat these plans until the terror of Undvik is no more.</p>

<h5>Enemy Attacks</h5>
<p>Nekkers live in the dark woods that grow in damp, mist-filled valleys, in colonies of one to several dozen individuals. They dig deep burrows for lairs and connect them with a network of narrow tunnels. They always attack in groups and by surprise, trying to surround their prey as quickly as possible, cutting off all escape routes. Luckily their attack is for the most part disorganized.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Charging Leap and Swipe:</strong> The Nekker leaps forward from mid-range with a leaping swipe. Well-timed sword slashes can interrupt this leap if it occurs just before the Nekker takes off.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Jumping Swipe:</strong> While hissing and baying at melee range, one or more Nekkers attempt to slice at your hide with thick-nailed clawing attacks. Parrying these is straightforward. Try employing Quen in case an attack gets through your defenses when you’re trying to parry or counter. After parrying, press home the advantage with a flurry of sword strikes.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Burrowing:</strong> Occasionally, Nekkers attempt to burrow to flee from your rage, or to maneuver behind you for a surprise attack. Yrden slows this down considerably (either before they burrow, or as they are appearing), and simple blocking or parrying stops this surprise attack.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Warriors:</strong> Tougher Nekkers usually have skull-shaped helmets and are fiercer opponents than the swarm of usual, bony foes. Feel free to target them first, though every single Nekker needs to die!</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics</h5>
<p>Individual Nekkers are weak, easy marks compared to other <a href="../../inventory-data/monsters.html" title="monsters">monsters</a>; Nekkers do not tend to fight as individuals. If you see one, expect anywhere from 2-10 more. Nekkers overwhelm their targets through sheer numbers, surrounding them, then pummeling and clawing victims to death. Even veteran Witchers can fall prey to this.</p>
<p>Initially approach Nekker <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> with a similar plan to dealing with a crowd of bandits: long-range weaponry that <a href="../../training/controls.html" title="controls">controls</a> groups of foes, such as Aard, or <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> such as Dancing Star or Northern Wind (the latter is excellent at freezing multiple Nekkers bunched together, followed up by rapid slicing and dicing before the effects of the freeze wear off). This helps thin out a Nekker herd before close <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> becomes necessary. Aard can knock a Nekker to its back, allowing for swift execution. Aard can also knock over several Nekkers at once, a good way to break through large groups of attackers.</p>
<p>For singling out Nekkers (such as Hagumban or Warriors), Axii can cause them to pause in a stupor (so you can cut down other foes or wound the tougher enemy with sword strikes). Igni is also a good choice for roasting groups, or individuals if you use Firestream. After incapacitating a tougher Nekker, follow up with Rend to deal a single, devastating strong attack. For waltzing through multiple Nekkers, parrying is great (countering is always possible), and Whirl (fast attack) is fantastic for demolishing a pack.</p>

<h5>Vulnerable Against</h5>
<figure class="half"><a href="../../../media/files/714-832_bestiary-credits-web-resources/image/129791.jpg"> <img src="../../../media/files/714-832_bestiary-credits-web-resources/image/129791.jpg"/> </a></figure>
<h5>Enemy Attacks</h5>
<p>Ice Trolls are crueler than their rocky kin. Though they use similar tactics in battle (tossing stones and swinging with their mighty fists) they are heartier and stronger than Rock Trolls and thus more dangerous. Rock Trolls, on the other hand, are quick to pummel and lob heavy rocks your way, but have been known to appreciate a conversation over bloodshed, and even help humans on occasion.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Rock Throwing (ranged):</strong> Running away from a Troll does not guarantee safety, as they can throw stones with alarming speed and accuracy. Fortunately, you can easily spot the Troll picking up a projectile. Simply dodge or roll to the side so you’re not struck (and possibly stunned) by it. There’s around a second of recovery time after a Troll throws, so if you can roll in and attack, this is a great time to do it.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Headbutt (melee):</strong><strong class="Red-Bold"></strong>With a quick backstep before a launch forward, the Troll butts anyone standing in front of it with a staggering headbutt. Be sure you’ve employed Quen or sidestepped to avoid this.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Leaping Ground-Pound (melee):</strong><strong class="Red-Bold"></strong>To close the distance, a Troll usually leaps in and pounds the ground with its pair of massive fists, which can stagger anyone in the area of effect. Dart backward, then step into melee range as the Troll recovers from completing this (missed) attack.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Pummeling Punches (melee):</strong><strong class="Red-Bold"></strong>The power and weight behind every punch thrown by a Troll means that they cannot be parried. Expect single swings and sometimes a series of three punches in a combo. A Witcher must be adept at evasion, striking when the opportunities appear, then dodging the inevitable counter-attack. Another option is to retreat and avoid the swiping, then stepping in at the end of the attack to inflict damage of your own.</p>
<p><strong class="Red-Bold">Defenses:</strong><strong class="Red-Bold"></strong>Both Troll types have backs covered in thick protective <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>, meaning one should never strike them from the rear. Meanwhile their mass means that the Aard Sign cannot move them. Lastly, never think of attacking Ice Trolls during a blizzard; they draw power from the surrounding cold and fight with increased strength.</p>
<h5>The Best Battle Tactics</h5>
<p>Trolls of both varieties are vicious fighters, and unfortunately must be fought head on. The <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> of stone or ice on their backs protects them too well for flanking tactics. Axii stuns them, but only for a brief second (and is only really useful for interrupting their rock throwing), and Yrden slows an already-sluggish foe, though you’re still within the range of its massive fists and head.</p>
<p>Tactics for slaying Trolls are as simple as the <a href="./beasts.html" title="beasts">beasts</a> themselves. It is important to cast Quen and protect yourself from a Troll’s fists as you’re fighting them head-on. Time your (strong) attacks just after each of the Troll’s swipes, stepping (or rolling) in and hitting the Troll before backing up again. Igni can cause more constant damage while this occurs. Quen is there so you’re not stunned and pummeled after a misstep. If you’re attacking from range, a Samum or Dancing Star bomb can soften these lumbering idiots up a bit.</p>
