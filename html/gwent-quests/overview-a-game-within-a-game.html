<p>From the revolting inns of <a href="../videos/treasure-hunts/velen.html" title="Velen">Velen</a> to the spectacular Royal Castle at Vizima, it seems anyone who is anyone is enjoying the dwarven card game known as <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a>. However, this enjoyable pastime can become hopelessly addictive when you realize there are a large number of cards to find to bolster your deck, improve your chances of victory, and complete your collection. While innkeepers and merchants may sell some cards, the following quests allow you to gather many high-value cards, which are critical to your collection.</p>
<p>Before you start your search for <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> cards, here are a few tactical tips to help you:</p>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>ON THE CARDS: GWENT COLLECTING TIPS</h3>
<p class="Tip"><a href="../../media/files/481-570_gwent_quests_treasure_hunt-web-resources-1/image/13729.png"><img src="../../media/files/481-570_gwent_quests_treasure_hunt-web-resources-1/image/13729.png"/></a><a href="../../media/files/481-570_gwent_quests_treasure_hunt-web-resources-1/image/13735.png"><img src="../../media/files/481-570_gwent_quests_treasure_hunt-web-resources-1/image/13735.png"/></a> <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> cards are acquired in a number of ways. Be sure you thoroughly inspect the Complete Card Checklist (starting on page 782), and <a href="../gwent/the-gwentlefolk-of-the-northern-realms/gwent-vendors-and-players-overview.html" title="the Gwentlefolk of the Northern Realms">the Gwentlefolk of the Northern Realms</a> (page 800) to further your search. In general, remember to find cards from the following places:</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong class="Body-bold">In your Base Deck:</strong> You begin with a fair number of cards (mainly from the <a href="../gwent/northern-realms-deck/northern-realms-leader-cards-5.html" title="Northern Realms deck">Northern Realms deck</a>) which you should employ in your initial games.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong class="Body-bold">Purchased:</strong> Some cards can be bought from a vendor (a merchant, innkeep, or other shop owner) at a variety of <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/carnal-knowledge/locations.html" title="locations">locations</a>.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong class="Body-bold">Won (Randomly):</strong> Some cards are won when you find a <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> player, challenge them to a game, and beat them for the first time. You claim their card, which is random. Most of these <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> players are no-name fans of the game, and almost always merchants, armorers, blacksmiths, herbalists, and the like.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong class="Body-bold">Found:</strong> When a player becomes “indisposed,” usually through death, you may find their cards left behind.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong class="Body-bold">Won (Specifically: <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> Quest):</strong> Some cards are acquired during the <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> Quests listed in this chapter. You face individuals in the different realms, one after the other, and acquire their cards when you beat them.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong class="Body-bold">Won (Specifically, Secondary Quest):</strong> There are cards to acquire during a couple of <a href="../secondary-quests/overview.html" title="Secondary Quests">Secondary Quests</a> too. These are listed in the adjacent table. Secondary Quest: High Stakes is primarily about completing a <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> tournament, and thus detailed in this section of the guide. Other <a href="../secondary-quests/overview.html" title="Secondary Quests">Secondary Quests</a> have <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> cards or tournaments as a small part of an overriding quest, and are listed in the Secondary Quest chapter.</p>
<p class="Tip">There is a simple pleasure in challenging <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> players across these lands, and learning from them. Before returning and fleecing them for a card and coins, obviously.</p>

<aside class="Caution">
<h3>OFF THE CARDS: KNOW WHEN TO HOLD ‘EM!</h3>
<p class="Caution">You may be wondering what happens if someone who is holding a unique <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> card becomes “indisposed” (usually by dying). Do your chances of gathering cards vanish? Not usually; any foes that die or depart an area leave their cards in the place they are usually found, or give you their cards automatically.</p>
<p class="Caution">For example, you may be attempting to locate Lambert, one of the <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> players to challenge during <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> Quest: Old Pals. Usually, you challenge him either at <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/kaer-morhen.html" title="Kaer Morhen">Kaer Morhen</a>, or during Secondary Quest: <a href="../secondary-quests/following-the-thread/bits-and-pieces.html" title="Following the Thread">Following the Thread</a>, at the Seven Cats Inn.</p>
<p class="Caution">However, if you started the <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> Quest after Main Quest: The Battle of <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/kaer-morhen.html" title="Kaer Morhen">Kaer Morhen</a>, and didn’t have an opportunity to talk to Lambert, he may have departed for pastures new. Fortunately, his card is still available (in this case, in the great hall at <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/kaer-morhen.html" title="Kaer Morhen">Kaer Morhen</a>, by Lambert’s bed).</p>
</aside>
<aside class="Caution">
<h3>OFF THE CARDS: DON’T BE COY: PLAY MY GAME!</h3>
<p class="Caution">Sometimes you’ll be chatting with a particular character in the hopes of starting a <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> bout, but the conversation topic never comes up. Why? Because you either have to exhaust all other conversation topics first, or you’ve visited the character out of order, and there are previous characters to win cards from first. Remember this!</p>
