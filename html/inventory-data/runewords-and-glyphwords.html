</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><th colspan="7">Runewords Tier 1</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Preservation</td>
<td>Lesser Svarog runestone</td>
<td>Lesser Devana runestone</td>
<td>Lesser Morana runestone</td>
<td>Armorer's Table and Grindstone bonuses never expire.</td>
<td>Armorer's Table increases your total <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> by 20% for 15 minutes and Grindstone increases your Attack Power by 20% for 15 minutes as well. With this Runeword those bonuses last infinitely. Their internal timer still runs and if you unequip the Runeword they will stay on you for their remaining time.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dumplings</td>
<td>Lesser Pyerog runestone</td>
<td>Lesser Tvarog runestone</td>
<td>Lesser Pyerog runestone</td>
<td>Any food consumed generates 100% more Vitality, but everything tastes like pierogis.</td>
<td>The duration of regeneration buff gained by food increases by +100%.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Placation</td>
<td>Lesser Devana runestone</td>
<td>Lesser Morana runestone</td>
<td>Lesser Stribog runestone</td>
<td>Once they reach their maximum level, Adrenaline Points steadily decline until they reach 0. During this time Vitality and Stamina regeneration are accelerated and Toxicity declines more quickly.</td>
<td>When the effect triggers no Adrenaline Points can be generated.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr><th colspan="7">Runewords Tier 2</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Severance</td>
<td>Zoria runestone</td>
<td>Veles runestone</td>
<td>Perun runestone</td>
<td>Increases the range of Whirl by 1.1 yards and Rend by 1.9 yards.</td>
<td></td>
<td>Whirl: Great to apply bleed (and other effects form your blades) to multiple enemies at the same time. Rend: When combined with crowd control (from <a href="./bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> or <a href="../training/combat/signs.html" title="signs">signs</a>) gives great opportunity to smash few enemies at the same time with one powerful strike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rejuvenation</td>
<td>Perun runestone</td>
<td>Svarog runestone</td>
<td>Stribog runestone</td>
<td>Each fatal blow dealt restores 25% of your Stamina.</td>
<td>This works only if you kill the enemy with sword.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elation</td>
<td>Dazhbog runestone</td>
<td>Veles runestone</td>
<td>Devana runestone</td>
<td>Fatal blows dealt with your sword give 0.1 to 0.25 Adrenaline Points.</td>
<td></td>
<td>For adrenaline users it's a good way to generate more adrenaline points when fighting with large groups of weaker enemies.</td>
</tr>
<tr><th colspan="7">Runewords Tier 3</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Replenishment</td>
<td>Greater Triglav runestone</td>
<td>Greater Morana runestone</td>
<td>Greater Dazhbog runestone</td>
<td>After you cast a Sign, an Adrenaline Point is consumed and your next sword attack is charged with the power of that Sign.</td>
<td>Aard staggers with a change for knockdown, Axii confuses, Yrden slows down, Igni deals additional 100% of damage dealt as fire damage and Quen heals you for 50% of damage dealt.</td>
<td>Perk Rage Management can be used to maximize potential of this enchantment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Invigoration</td>
<td>Greater Devana runestone</td>
<td>Greater Zoria runestone</td>
<td>Greater Perun runestone</td>
<td>When at maximum Vitality, any Vitality regeneration turns into added damage (up to +50%) on your next strike.</td>
<td>Extra vitality regeneration starts filling up a 'virtual' vitality pool. The percentage of this pool that is filled by extra regeneration is equal to the damage percentage bonus. So for example if you have 8000 maximum vitality, over-healing 1000 vitality points will grant you a 1/8th bonus to damage. This bonus is capped at +50%. The bonus will stay on your character either until you strike someone or your vitality drops below 100%.</td>
<td>You can use White Raffards Decoction when at &gt; 50% of maximum vitality to instantly heal to maximum AND gain +50% damage bonus. Also having a Swallow will quickly build up your over-heal. Quen shield will also come in handy to preserve that buff and make sure you won't lose it due to being hit by enemies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prolongation</td>
<td>Greater Morana runestone</td>
<td>Greater Perun runestone</td>
<td>Greater Svarog runestone</td>
<td>Each unblocked blow increases potion duration time by 0.5s.</td>
<td>This also works with <a href="./decoctions.html" title="decoctions">decoctions</a> as they are <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> as well. Each hit will increase duration of ALL active <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> at once.</td>
<td>Valid choice for non-<a href="./alchemy.html" title="alchemy">alchemy</a> builds. Good for long fights with big enemies, also works very well against multiple enemies when combined with Blizzard Potion.</td>
</tr>
<tr><th colspan="7">Glyphwords Tier 1</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Deflection</td>
<td>Lesser Glyph of Aard</td>
<td>Lesser Glyph of Warding</td>
<td>Lesser Glyph of Reinforcement</td>
<td><a href="./armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> deflects all arrows.</td>
<td>All <a href="./bolts.html" title="bolts">bolts</a> and arrows are automatically deflected. This will not however work with magic projectiles.</td>
<td>Good chocie for <a href="../training/combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a>-oriented builds, especially on higher difficulty levels where single arrow is able to chop huge amount of Geralt's vitality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Usurpation</td>
<td>Lesser Glyph of Axii</td>
<td>Lesser Glyph of Binding</td>
<td>Lesser Glyph of Reinforcement</td>
<td>When an enemy affected by Axii dies, the effect transfers to the nearest target.</td>
<td>The duration of the effect on a new target is equal to the duration remaining from the initial target or 5 seconds, whichever is higher. So if the effect had 3.5 sec of remaining time at the moment of kill, the effect will be added to new target with 5 sec duration.</td>
<td>Charged Rend and strong <a href="./bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> are great to trigger this enchant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignition</td>
<td>Lesser Glyph of Igni</td>
<td>Lesser Glyph of Yrden</td>
<td>Lesser Glyph of Warding</td>
<td>Enemies set alight with Igni have a 25% chance to ignite other enemies within a 2 yard radius.</td>
<td>This check is done periodically as long as the target is on fire. The effect does not trigger itself (enemies ignited due to runeword will not trigger the runeword's effect) so there is no 'chain reaction' possible.</td>
<td>Quite usefull as crowd control with use of basic version of the Igni sign. Some enemies will be ignited by Igni itself while others being nearby can set ablaze from the Glyphword, creating a "firewall" in front of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Heft</td>
<td>Lesser Glyph of Quen</td>
<td>Lesser Glyph of Mending</td>
<td>Lesser Glyph of Reinforcement</td>
<td>All equipped <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> items are treated as Heavy <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>.</td>
<td>This has all consequences of <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> type: it will change stamina regeneration and will work with proper Perks. It affects all <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> type items equipped: <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>, <a href="./armor/gloves.html" title="gloves">gloves</a>, <a href="./armor/pants.html" title="pants">pants</a> and <a href="./armor/boots.html" title="boots">boots</a>.</td>
<td>Use it with combination with Bear School Techniques Perk to get the perk bonus while wearing any <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Depletion</td>
<td>Lesser Glyph of Aard</td>
<td>Lesser Glyph of Axii</td>
<td>Lesser Glyph of Reinforcement</td>
<td>Hitting enemies with Aard reduces their Stamina by 50%.</td>
<td></td>
<td>When on low stamina enemies will be unable to counter of parry so even if you cannot knock down / stagger an enemy you might still find this usefull as a way of creating an opening for your strikes.</td>
</tr>
<tr><th colspan="7">Glyphwords Tier 2</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Balance</td>
<td>Glyph of Axii</td>
<td>Glyph of Mending</td>
<td>Glyph of Reinforcement</td>
<td>All equipped <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> items are treated as Medium <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>.</td>
<td>This has all consequences of <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> type: it will change stamina regeneration and will work with proper Perks.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rotation</td>
<td>Glyph of Igni</td>
<td>Glyph of Binding</td>
<td>Glyph of Reinforcement</td>
<td>Igni's basic attack strikes all opponents in a 360-degree radius, but no longer applies the Burning effect.</td>
<td></td>
<td>Decent alternative for Aard Sweep, shines if your build lacks Skill Slots for Aard,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Beguilement</td>
<td>Glyph of Axii</td>
<td>Glyph of Igni</td>
<td>Glyph of Mending</td>
<td>Enemies affected by Axii will be affected for 2s longer for each blow they land.</td>
<td>Each successfull attack landed by a Hypnotised enemy will increase the duration of Hypnosis by 2 seconds.</td>
<td>You might want to attack the enemies first to bring down their health a bit and the use alternate mode of Axii to hypnotize an enemy. He will then be able to quickly dispose of already wounded foes and thus quickly build up additional duration of the Hypnosis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Entanglement</td>
<td>Glyph of Yrden</td>
<td>Glyph of Axii</td>
<td>Glyph of Binding</td>
<td>When a trap set by Yrden hits an enemy, an Yrden glyph is placed at that position.</td>
<td>In the alternate mode Yrden places a trap that shoots lightning at enemies or incoming projectiles. When a hit is done Yrden Glyph (slowing area) is placed at the position of impact. The Glyph will use all extra effects of Yrden skill (so for example with Sustained <a href="./glyphs.html" title="Glyphs">Glyphs</a> Skill you can place several <a href="./glyphs.html" title="Glyphs">Glyphs</a> this way simultaneously).</td>
<td>With this Glyphword Yrden pretty much becomes a fire-and-forget mechanism. Trap will keep placing Yrden <a href="./glyphs.html" title="Glyphs">Glyphs</a> so you will be able to use your stamina for other <a href="../training/combat/signs.html" title="signs">signs</a> or skills in the meantime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Protection</td>
<td>Glyph of Quen</td>
<td>Glyph of Yrden</td>
<td>Glyph of Warding</td>
<td>When you enter <a href="../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>, there's a 100 percent chance you will automatically get a Quen shield without using any Stamina.</td>
<td>Whenever you start <a href="../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> a basic Quen shield is applied for free.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr><th colspan="7">Glyphwords Tier 3</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Levity</td>
<td>Greater Glyph of Aard</td>
<td>Greater Glyph of Mending</td>
<td>Greater Glyph of Reinforcement</td>
<td>All equipped <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> items are treated as Light <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>.</td>
<td>This has all consequences of <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> type: it will change stamina regeneration and will work with proper Perks.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Retribution</td>
<td>Greater Glyph of Quen</td>
<td>Greater Glyph of Igni</td>
<td>Greater Glyph of Reinforcement</td>
<td>Gives a 30% chance of returning a portion of damage received to the attacker.</td>
<td>Returned damage is equal to 2/3rd of your total <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> and ignores all resistances and <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> of the attacker.</td>
<td>When an enemy is hit with this effect he will play a hit animation breaking his current action. This becomes especially handy with enemies that attack with flurry of blows as being hit will break their frenzy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Possession</td>
<td>Greater Glyph of Axii</td>
<td>Greater Glyph of Aard</td>
<td>Greater Glyph of Binding</td>
<td>When an opponent incluenced by Axii dies, the effect transfers to a nearby target. The effect's duration increases by 2 seconds for each blow the affected target lands.</td>
<td>The duration of the effect on a new target is equal to the duration remaining from the initial target or 5 seconds, whichever is higher. So if the effect had 3.5 sec of remaining time at the moment of kill, the effect will be added to new target with 5 sec duration. Each successfull attack landed by a Hypnotised enemy will increase the duration of Hypnosis by 2 seconds.</td>
<td>You might want to attack the enemies first to bring down their health a bit and the use alternate mode of Axii to hypnotize an enemy. He will then be able to quickly dispose of already wounded foes and thus quickly build up additional duration of the Hypnosis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Eruption</td>
<td>Greater Glyph of Igni</td>
<td>Greater Glyph of Quen</td>
<td>Greater Glyph of Reinforcement</td>
<td>Foes set alight by Igni explode when they die and ignite nearby foes.</td>
<td>All enemies in a 3 meters radius from killed enemy receive 50 fire damage (that scales up with your Spell Power) and have a 50% chance to be affected by Burning. This also triggers if enemy dies due to Burning effect applied by Igni.</td>
<td>Set enemies ablaze with Igni and then lure other enemies close to the burning ones so that all of them can experience some nice fire damage.</td>
