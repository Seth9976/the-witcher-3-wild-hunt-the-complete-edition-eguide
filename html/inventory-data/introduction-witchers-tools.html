<p>The following inventory charts and tables provide a deeper look into the thousands of <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a>, enchantments, swords, <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> sets and items you can craft and acquire during your adventure. If you're interested in the properties of an item you haven't found yet, want to compare similar items or simply want to research the best items to be found, you'll find the information here.</p>
<p>There are a few general rules you should be aware of before digging in:</p>
<h4>STAT ACCURACY</h4>
<p>As described in the skills section of <a href="../training/overview.html" title="Training">Training</a>, the use of different <a href="./oils.html" title="oils">oils</a>, <a href="./runestones.html" title="runestones">runestones</a>, <a href="./glyphs.html" title="glyphs">glyphs</a>, <a href="./mutagens.html" title="mutagens">mutagens</a> and other preparation, will affect an item's base statistics. This may increase the damage dealt by a sword, the type of resistances provided by an <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> and the power of your Sign abilities. To account for this, the game automatically calculates those effects and applies them to the spells and items you see in game. The values listed in the following pages represent the base values for a specific item and may vary considerably from what you experience based on the choices you make during your campaign. Still, these values represent the relative strength of each item and represent an accurate measure for comparison.</p>
<h4>LEVELED STATS</h4>
<p>Basic properties of <a href="./steel-and-silver-swords.html" title="steel and silver swords">steel and silver swords</a> are increased as you progress through the game; you will always receive a variant that is most appropriate to your current level. As a result, higher-level versions may have better statistics than the examples listed here.</p>
<h4>STACKING</h4>
<p>Item upgrades like <a href="./oils.html" title="oils">oils</a>, <a href="./glyphs.html" title="glyphs">glyphs</a> and <a href="./runestones.html" title="runestones">runestones</a> can be combined to create a number of conditions. This means that the benefits of each effect are cumulative and can be stacked to strengthen your build. Additionally, some effects are multipliers and may scale your overall ability up quickly.</p>
<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>As the sheer number of items you can find (or create) on your travels numbers into the thousands, this streamlined section delves into each individual item type, and (where appropriate) plucks out the very finest, or recommended variants, so you can aim to equip it to bolster both your prowess and progress.</p>
<p>For those requiring an exhaustive, overwhelming, and utterly complete list of every single inventory element you can interact with, utilize the searchable online eGuide component of this book (free with purchase). It provides updated statistical knowledge of every single item available to you. It allows you to view every type of weapon, diagram, crafting material, and all other items you may come across on your travels. It is useful for comparing statistics between multiple weapons of the same type (for example), and includes all items from the Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine Expansions.</p>
<p>The online Inventory chapter provide copious additional information: Examples include the disassembled components each weapon can be broken down into, the number of upgrade slots, the usual prices you can sell items for, and a host of other helpful data, including a hint from the venerable Witcher Vesemir! You are encouraged to view all the Inventory tables as part of your free eGuide. The following charts and tables are available whenever you wish to access them:</p>
<h3>ITEM DATA</h3>
<p>There are over 2,500 individual “base” items that you can find during your explorations. These are divided into Type (for example, masks, <a href="./crafting-elements/miscellaneous.html" title="miscellaneous">miscellaneous</a> items, <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> cards, crafting schematics, recipes, junk, <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>, oil, or edibles). The online chart lists them all, along with statistical data. Unless otherwise stated, these items are randomly found or purchased, and some items (such as masks worn by party-goers) may not be accessible to you.</p>
<h3>SHOPS: AVAILABLE ITEMS</h3>
<p>Are you wanting to know exactly what each merchant, armorer, blacksmith, or other trader has in stock? Then consult this chart, which details every single item a merchant is likely to have on hand. The chances of a merchant having an item is also listed.</p>
<h3>SHOPS: ITEM LOCATIONS</h3>
<p>This chart lists all items merchants carry, and the individual merchants you can visit to buy each item from. All told, and including duplicate or similar items, there are over 3,000 items you can purchase from vendors across these lands.</p>
<h3>ALCHEMY</h3>
<p>There are over 120 alchemic components you can find or break down, and all are used in the making of <a href="./oils.html" title="oils">oils</a>, <a href="./bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a>, and <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a>. The online chart provides a price, weight, rarity rating, as well as recipe requirements for every single component: Minerals, Alcohols, <a href="./crafting-elements/monster-remains.html" title="Monster Remains">Monster Remains</a>, Substances, and Mutagen Color Changes.</p>
<h3>ARMOR</h3>
<p>There are over 250 different pieces of non-<a href="./crafted-armor/crafted-armor.html" title="crafted armor">crafted armor</a> you can find during your adventure (though some <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> pieces are craftable, <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> in this table can be found already complete). The online chart for <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> shows the approximate price, the weight and quality, durability, number of sockets (for <a href="./glyphs.html" title="Glyphs">Glyphs</a>), and a host of possible bonuses. Not only that, but every disassembled component is also shown, so you can see what recycled items each <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> piece breaks down into. These are subdivided into the following sections: <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> Casual, <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> Light, <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> Medium, <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> Heavy, Relic <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>, and pieces for chest, <a href="./armor/gloves.html" title="gloves">gloves</a>, <a href="./armor/pants.html" title="pants">pants</a>, and <a href="./armor/boots.html" title="boots">boots</a>.</p>
<h3>ARMOR (CRAFTED)</h3>
<p>There are almost 150 different pieces of craftable <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>, which are acquired after finding a diagram with the same name as the listed <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>. These <a href="./diagrams/crafting-component-diagrams.html" title="diagrams">diagrams</a> are then taken to an Armorer who, if competent enough, creates the <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> from base components. The most common (and potent) <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> of this type is the different “Witcher School” gear, which form the basis of the Scavenger Hunt quests.</p>
<p>The statistical data of this online chart reflects the same information as that contained in the <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> (non crafted) chart. These are subdivided into the following sections: Light, Medium, Heavy, Witcher Sets, Human <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> from Hearts of Stone, and pieces for chest, <a href="./armor/gloves.html" title="gloves">gloves</a>, <a href="./armor/pants.html" title="pants">pants</a>, and <a href="./armor/boots.html" title="boots">boots</a>.</p>
<p><strong class="Bold">Recommended <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>: </strong>New Moon, Witcher Feline, Witcher Ursine gear.</p>
<h3>BOLTS</h3>
<p>Aside from the regular <a href="./bolts.html" title="bolts">bolts</a> for your trusty crossbow, there are 14 specialized bolt types you can equip. This chart allows you to compare the damage (both normal and special) they inflict, and any bonuses they give.</p>
<p><strong class="Bold">Recommended <a href="./bolts.html" title="Bolts">Bolts</a>: </strong>Harpoon bolt, Precision Bolt, Exploding bolt</p>
<h3>BOMBS</h3>
<p>There are eight types of <a href="./bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a>, and three versions of each (giving you 24 different bomb types in total), and this chart gives a description of each effect (both damage and passive) as well as the recipe requirements for each.</p>
<p><strong class="Bold">Recommended <a href="./bombs.html" title="Bombs">Bombs</a>: </strong>Grapeshot, Dragon’s Dream, Northern Wind</p>
<h3>BOOKS</h3>
<p>There are approximately 280 <a href="./books.html" title="books">books</a> to acquire on your travels. As many are found randomly, you are encouraged to search every location, and purchase <a href="./books.html" title="books">books</a> from vendors listed as having <a href="./books.html" title="books">books</a> for sale. <a href="./books.html" title="Books">Books</a> are subdivided into Monster Tomes, Functional <a href="./books.html" title="Books">Books</a>, Common <a href="./books.html" title="Books">Books</a>, and Notes and Journals.</p>
<h3>CROSSBOWS</h3>
<p>Including variants, expect to find 15 different <a href="./crossbows.html" title="crossbows">crossbows</a> on your adventures. This chart lists them all, along with the attack power, normal and special damage caused, and what items you receive if you recycle (dismantle) them.</p>
<p><strong class="Bold">Recommended <a href="./crossbows.html" title="Crossbows">Crossbows</a>: </strong>Feline, Elven, Ofir <a href="./crossbows.html" title="crossbows">crossbows</a></p>
<h3>CRAFTING ELEMENTS</h3>
<p>With close to 300 different base materials and elements you can find to craft with, or recycle (dismantle) to component parts, this table provides invaluable data regarding the different types of <a href="./crafting-elements/common-materials.html" title="crafting elements">crafting elements</a>, and what recycled items you can claim as well. These are subdivided into the following sections: <a href="./crafting-elements/common-materials.html" title="Common Materials">Common Materials</a>, Crafting Materials, <a href="./crafting-elements/metals-and-alloys.html" title="Metals and Alloys">Metals and Alloys</a>, <a href="./crafting-elements/monster-remains.html" title="Monster Remains">Monster Remains</a>, Other Items, <a href="./crafting-elements/clutter.html" title="Clutter">Clutter</a>, Leather and Hides, Pelts, <a href="./crafting-elements/chitin-scale.html" title="Chitin Scale">Chitin Scale</a>, <a href="./crafting-elements/precious-gems.html" title="Precious Gems">Precious Gems</a>, and <a href="./crafting-elements/jewelry.html" title="Jewelry">Jewelry</a>.</p>
<h3>DIAGRAMS</h3>
<p>There are well over 400 different <a href="./diagrams/crafting-component-diagrams.html" title="diagrams">diagrams</a> you can collect and all have a general use; they allow you to create a crafted item from a variety of base components. This online chart reveals every single diagram schematic, along with the item created, its value, cost to create, and crafting requirements. These are subdivided into the following sections: General <a href="./diagrams/crafting-component-diagrams.html" title="Diagrams">Diagrams</a>, Repair Kits, Ranged, Steel Weapons, Relic Steel Weapons, Silver Weapons, Relic Silver Weapons, <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> (including <a href="./armor/gloves.html" title="gloves">gloves</a>, <a href="./armor/pants.html" title="pants">pants</a>, and <a href="./armor/boots.html" title="boots">boots</a>), <a href="./runestones.html" title="Runestones">Runestones</a> and <a href="./glyphs.html" title="Glyphs">Glyphs</a>, and Runewords.</p>
<h3>DECOCTIONS</h3>
<p>Like Runstones or <a href="./glyphs.html" title="Glyphs">Glyphs</a>, <a href="./decoctions.html" title="Decoctions">Decoctions</a> directly enhance your stats, are drunk like <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a>, removed by sipping on White Honey, refilled during Meditation with Alcohols, and can only be crafted. There are 28 to concoct, and this chart provides descriptions of each decoction’s effects, toxicity rating, duration, and most importantly, the recipe requirements.</p>
<h3>DYE</h3>
<p>Should you wish to make your Witcher Gear more colorful, there are a dozen different <a href="./dyes.html" title="Dyes">Dyes</a> you can create, as well as a removal should you wish to change colors. This chart details the recipe requirements to concoct each dye.</p>
<h3>FOOD</h3>
<p>Edibles supply you with a small amount of vitality regeneration; wheats and fruits are less potent than vegetables, dairy, meat, or fish. Drinks are quickly consumed to regain stamina, and juices or milk provides the most hydration. Some edibles can be used in <a href="./alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a> and to replenish <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a>. Collectible <a href="./foods.html" title="foods">foods</a> can be sold for an additional price at herbalist or <a href="./alchemy.html" title="alchemy">alchemy</a> shops. Certain alcoholic beverages add to your toxicity rating and may result in temporary blurred vision. All are listed here. These are subdivided into the following sections: Alcohols, Dairy Products (milk, yogurt, and cheese), Protein (including meat, poultry, fish, beans, and eggs), Fruits, Nuts, and Vegetables, and Bread and Cereal.</p>
<h3>GLYPHS</h3>
<p>Place a Glyph into a piece of <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> you own that has a socket in it, and a passive bonus is granted. Lesser <a href="./glyphs.html" title="Glyphs">Glyphs</a> give weak bonuses, but these can be combined (or “stacked”), or Greater <a href="./glyphs.html" title="Glyphs">Glyphs</a> inserted for more significant boosts. For this enchantment to occur, a Glyph of Infusion must be prepared first; which are found by looting containers and corpses, or bought from Armorers or Blacksmiths. There are nine different Glyph types, and three variations of each (27 in total). The online chart shows them all, along with the bonuses you receive, and the components you receive if you dismantle a Glyph.</p>
<h3>GLYPHWORDS</h3>
<p>Once <a href="../training/the-ofieri-runewright.html" title="the Ofieri Runewright">the Ofieri Runewright</a> makes an appearance, you have the ability to imbue your <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> with a variety of powerful Glyph and Runewords. A chart revealing both Glyphwords and Runewords, their Tier, crafting component requirements, descriptions, and additional explanations and tips on their use, is available online.</p>
<h3>HERBS</h3>
<p>Acting as crafting ingredients, and occurring in all regions of the world (aside from the <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/toussaint.html" title="Toussaint">Toussaint</a>-only <a href="./herbs.html" title="herbs">herbs</a>), this chart lists all 38 available <a href="./herbs.html" title="herbs">herbs</a> that can be picked from a bush, or plucked from the ground.</p>
<h3>HORSE ITEMS</h3>
<p>Your faithful steed Roach has three enhancing items you can equip her with, and these are detailed in this chart. These don’t include <a href="./trophies.html" title="Trophies">Trophies</a> (which are also affixed to Roach, but don’t augment your <a href="./horse.html" title="horse">horse</a>’s statistics). These are subdivided into the following sections: Blinders, Saddles, and Saddlebags.</p>
<p><strong class="Bold">Recommended Blinders: </strong>Zerrikanian, Undvik, or any <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/toussaint.html" title="Toussaint">Toussaint</a> Blinder</p>
<p><strong class="Bold">Recommended Saddles: </strong>Any <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/toussaint.html" title="Toussaint">Toussaint</a> Saddle</p>
<p><strong class="Bold">Recommended Saddlebags: </strong><a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/toussaint.html" title="Toussaint">Toussaint</a> Horsebag</p>
<h3>MONSTERS</h3>
<p>Know your foe. The <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/bestiary/a-witchers-guide-to-killing-monsters.html" title="Bestiary">Bestiary</a> is your best friend. All of the critical information on the items that work against the hordes of creatures you’ll face are at your personal disposal. Also, learn the creature categories (<a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/bestiary/necrophages.html" title="Necrophages">Necrophages</a>, Relics, Elementals, etc.). The online chart’s statistics represent the base level of ability for each entity. While these values may be modified as you progress through the adventure, they make an excellent reference regarding the threat level of each entity and the types of damage it may deal.</p>
<p>Additionally, unique variants of some creatures may be encountered during quests. Specific damage values may vary but each attack is based on the base type as described in the online table. Watch out for Monster Nests to clear them out and make use of the ingredients they carry. This is also serves as a source of ingredients for the Witcher gear <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> and weapons for crafting those items at Blacksmiths. When you have the chance to spot an enemy at a distance and you know what you’re up against, you can pull up your inventory to apply the <a href="./oils.html" title="oils">oils</a>, down the <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a>, and slot the <a href="./bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> that will help you quickly dispatch the dark denizens before you. If it’s not a specific monster you’ve encountered before, but you think you know what type it is. Apply the oil for that enemy type and you’ll conquer them in a flash. The <a href="./monsters.html" title="monsters">monsters</a> are separated into the following sections (each listing the enemy’s attack power, damage, items they drop, specific items, and specific remains): Common Animals, Wild Animals, Monster Nests and Bosses, <a href="./monsters.html" title="Monsters">Monsters</a>.</p>
<h3>MUTAGENS</h3>
<p><a href="./mutagens.html" title="Mutagens">Mutagens</a> are rare organic ingredients that can be obtained by boiling the mashed remains of defeated <a href="./monsters.html" title="monsters">monsters</a> with other alchemical components to extract the <a href="./oils.html" title="oils">oils</a> and volatile organic compounds used to create <a href="./decoctions.html" title="decoctions">decoctions</a>. <a href="./decoctions.html" title="Decoctions">Decoctions</a> can used to increase your prowess in <a href="../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> or to increase character stats. See <a href="./decoctions.html" title="Decoctions">Decoctions</a> for further information. <a href="./mutagens.html" title="Mutagens">Mutagens</a> are also used to bolster Character Abilities by selecting the desired mutagen slot in the Character Panel.</p>
<p><a href="./mutagens.html" title="Mutagens">Mutagens</a> also form the basis of the Mutations Menu, where the most powerful mutations of all are available.</p>
<p>You can reslot <a href="./mutagens.html" title="mutagens">mutagens</a> as needed making it possible to always keep the strongest <a href="./mutagens.html" title="mutagens">mutagens</a> you posses where they will have the greatest effect. Lesser <a href="./mutagens.html" title="mutagens">mutagens</a> are ideally sold to alchemists and herbalists or used as alchemical ingredients for mutagen <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> you will craft. Great <a href="./mutagens.html" title="mutagens">mutagens</a>, should always be used whenever they enhance your build.</p>
<p>There are two types of <a href="./mutagens.html" title="mutagens">mutagens</a>, Lesser and Greater. Each type is obtained randomly and can be found by looting the corpses of <a href="./monsters.html" title="monsters">monsters</a> you’ve defeated. Greater <a href="./mutagens.html" title="mutagens">mutagens</a> can only be recovered from the corpse of unique <a href="./monsters.html" title="monsters">monsters</a>, generally those found when completing Monster Hunt objectives.</p>
<p>While <a href="./mutagens.html" title="mutagens">mutagens</a> can be used to craft <a href="./decoctions.html" title="decoctions">decoctions</a>, they can also be used to increase player statistics. When used in the character menu, <a href="./mutagens.html" title="mutagens">mutagens</a> will appear using one of three different colors; Red, Green and Blue. The <a href="./mutagens.html" title="Mutagens">Mutagens</a> chart lists all of them, including their weight, toxicity, and attack power, sign intensity, or vitality bonuses.</p>
<h3>OILS</h3>
<p>Including enhanced and superior variants, there are 36 <a href="./oils.html" title="oils">oils</a> available to you. <a href="./oils.html" title="Oils">Oils</a> can be applied to a Witcher’s steel or silver blade to grant a temporary bonus. This bonus will either increase critical effects or increase damage dealt against a specific type of enemy while the effect lasts.</p>
<p><a href="./oils.html" title="Oils">Oils</a> must be prepared from alchemical formulas using the substances listed in the online <a href="./oils.html" title="Oils">Oils</a> chart, under Recipe Requirements. This is by far the most economical way to enhance your items and allows for a great deal of flexibility when preparing for multiple types of targets. You can oil your blade from the inventory menu, so you can apply a bonus during the middle of a fight as desired.</p>
<p>If you know you’re going to be facing large groups of humans, slap some Hang Man’s Venom on your Steel Sword. These are the most common enemies you’ll face during quests inside the city walls of <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/novigrad.html" title="Novigrad">Novigrad</a>, so it’s a safe bet to keep this oil active as often as possible when you’re not roaming the wilderness.</p>
<h3>POTIONS</h3>
<p>There are 42 different <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> available to you, assuming you count enhanced and superior variants of most <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a>. Drink <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> to temporarily alter your stats, providing mild boosts to performance with little or no drawbacks (aside from toxicity). Enhanced and Superior <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> are more potent, and are usually more toxic. You can drink up to three <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a>, but only tolerate up to 100 toxicity points before you’re poisoned. While <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> cannot be purchased, shops are a great source for finding new recipes. By learning new recipes, you will be able to increase the strength of existing <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> and unlock new effects to diversify your abilities. While it is very economical to brew <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> from formulas. Most <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> require alchemical substances, which are obtained from common components found in the environment and monster loot. Only a handful of high-end <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a>, like Tawny Owl, require any sort of rare alchemical substance like Sewant Mushrooms.</p>
<p>Certain <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> are designed to be used in conjunction with other <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a>. This is particularly true of <a href="./potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> that offer powerful buffs countered by inherent flaws. In these cases, a second potion can be used to compensate any negative effects or eliminate them entirely.</p>
<p>This chart describes the effect of each potion, the price you trade it, along with its toxicity, duration, number of doses, and the recipe requirements for each.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 1.17em;"><a href="./runestones.html" title="RUNESTONES">RUNESTONES</a></span></h3>
<p>These are used to enhance a socketed steel or silver sword with a permanent enchantment that increases weapon damage, adds persistent conditions to enemies, and augments spell power. Remember that once a Runestone is embedded, it cannot be removed without destroying the weapon. <a href="./runestones.html" title="Runestones">Runestones</a> are crafted from <a href="./diagrams/crafting-component-diagrams.html" title="diagrams">diagrams</a> or purchased from merchants. The <a href="./runestones.html" title="Runestones">Runestones</a> chart details every single Runestone, revealing the statistical differences between lesser, regular, and greater <a href="./runestones.html" title="Runestones">Runestones</a>, and what additional conditions (burning damage, for example) or abilities are augmented for each one.</p>
<h3>RUNEWORDS</h3>
<p>Once <a href="../training/the-ofieri-runewright.html" title="the Ofieri Runewright">the Ofieri Runewright</a> makes an appearance, you have the ability to imbue your <a href="./armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> with a variety of powerful Glyphwords and Runewords.

<h3>TROPHIES</h3>
<p>After completing <a href="../witcher-contracts/overview.html" title="Witcher Contracts">Witcher Contracts</a>, and slicing off a major appendage (usually the head) of a vanquished monster, you are imbued with a bonus if you affix the trophy to Roach’s saddle. This chart details the different bonuses you can expect to have.</p>
<h3>WEAPONS</h3>
<p>The mainstay of your non-magical offensive capabilities, the weapons chart details over 120 different blades to skewer, rend, and tear at your foes with. The name of the sword is shown, along with the price, weight, quality, upgrade sockets (for <a href="./runestones.html" title="Runestones">Runestones</a> or Runewords), and the various damage ratings each has (from usual slashing damage to chances to inflict bleeding, and the like). The origin is also noted, so you can cross-reference with the merchant chart on page 816 of this guide. The component parts of each weapon are also listed. Weapons are subdivided into the following sections: Human Steel, Nonhuman Steel, Human Silver, Nonhuman Silver, Relic Steel, and Relic Silver.</p>
