<p>The General Abilities branch does not focus on any given aspect of a Witcher’s skills. However, the abilities found here can influence your overall archetype. You can purchase any of the 20 abilities here at any time you like (none need to be “unlocked”), and each one costs only a single point (none of them have “Levels”). However, unlike groups of <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a>, <a href="../combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a>, or <a href="../../inventory-data/alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a> abilities, these do not “stack” together with <a href="../../inventory-data/mutagens.html" title="Mutagens">Mutagens</a>, lessening their usefulness. As you progress, you may find no more than three of these abilities are needed when perfecting a character build.</p>

Some of the best are the Techniques, granting amazing <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> bonuses for only one ability point (such as Griffin School Techniques, offering excellent bonuses to your Sign Intensity and Stamina for each piece of medium <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> you wear)! Use them to gain statistical bonuses depending on the <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> you wear. Pictured is an example of Aard at its maximum intensity; look at those bandits fly!</figcaption> </figcaption></figure>

<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> This can be helpful if you haven’t bothered to place many points into <a href="../../inventory-data/alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a> to build up your tolerance, or you want to drink more <a href="../../inventory-data/potions.html" title="Potions">Potions</a> as <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> progresses. The Adrenaline Point deduction can be worrying if you’re using other abilities (like sword attacks!) that require Adrenaline too, so check the benefits of swigging multiple <a href="../../inventory-data/potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> outweigh your AP drain. Beware of using this with certain abilities (such as Endure Pain) that actually require a Toxicity level, as this makes acquiring a high Toxicity more difficult!</p>

<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> If you’re finding it troublesome to fiddle with your crossbow string every so often, and you’re focusing on an archetype that is mainly planning on dropping every foe using a crossbow from a distance, then this is marginally useful. But there are many more helpful abilities. Think about how often you’re reloading a crossbow in fights compared to, say, using a sword and requiring an Adrenaline boost. If the answer is “not as often,” then this ability may not be for you.</p>

<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> You’re usually employing <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> at only limited points during your adventure. But if you’re lobbing explosives at foes more often than slaying with swords, give this ability a chance; the Adrenaline Points it helps generate (through damage; you must hurt a foe with a bomb!) helps you continue the fight. Note that <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> which explode into fragments, and therefore inflict more damage (and to multiple targets) generate more APs. However, it is usually better to utilize <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a> abilities (as each gives an AP gain) instead. </p>
<h5><a href="../../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/15_battle_frenzy.png"><img src="../../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/15_battle_frenzy.png"/></a><a href="../../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/34894.png"><img src="../../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/34894.png"/></a> Battle Frenzy</h5>
<p>Instead of its previous effect, Battle Trance now increases critical hit chance by 8% per Adrenaline Point.</p>

<td class="Basic-Table"><strong class="Body-bold">Points in branch needed to unlock: 0</strong></td>

</table>
<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> Battle Trance is a branch of your <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a> abilities, and each time you land a blow in <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>, Adrenaline Points are generated. Each AP increases weapon damage by 10 percent. But with Battle Frenzy, each AP increases your critical hit chance by eight percent instead. This is helpful for character archetypes where your critical damage is large, but your chance of scoring a critical hit is low. Of course, you can also use it with characters that already have a higher chance to score critical hits, and almost guarantee a critical hit for each attack! Simply check to see how impressive your critical damage is first, so you’re maximizing this ability.</p>
<h5><a href="../../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/16_strong_back.png"><img src="../../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/16_strong_back.png"/></a> Strong Back</h5>

<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> This is a helpful “spare” ability to purchase and utilize when you’re foraging, rather than preparing for a difficult battle. Before you choose it, think about the weight bonuses that adding Saddlebags to Roach gives you, and the items you can store in your Stash chests. If you still need more carry weight, pick this.</p>

<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> Though this isn’t as useful as one of the three “Techniques” General abilities or Rage Management, having a permanent bonus from one of the <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/places-of-power.html" title="Places of Power">Places of Power</a> (which increases the intensity of one of your five <a href="../combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a>) is moderately beneficial. But remember you still have to equip this ability into a slot, so this takes away a bonus that may stack, or offer larger bonuses when partnered with a Mutagen (such as linking three <a href="../combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> abilities together in your Character Menu). Also, with Fast-Travel you’re always less than 30 minutes away from a Place of Power to redraw the power from (30 minutes being the time the power normally lasts for).</p>

<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> This affects any “Food” items only, such as dumplings and other goods found sold primarily by Innkeeps. Though helpful, there are much more potent <a href="../../inventory-data/potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> to use during <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>, and the simple act of Meditation restores Vitality once <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> is over. However, if you lack <a href="../../inventory-data/potions.html" title="potions">potions</a> and <a href="../../inventory-data/decoctions.html" title="decoctions">decoctions</a>, and primarily use food during fights to increase your health, this is most helpful.</p>

<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> One of the biggest drawbacks when using <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> or special <a href="../../inventory-data/bolts.html" title="bolts">bolts</a> at close range, is being struck by shrapnel, or the after-effects of an explosion. This nullifies that completely, and is a reasonable choice for those wishing to engage foes (particularly crowds of bandits) in more brazen <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> while juggling projectiles. The only negative of this ability, is the lack of obvious times when it helps you immeasurably (you can heal, or be more careful with your area-effect weapons instead), but it does help fighting using <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> in confined spaces, like dungeons.</p>
<h5><a href="../../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/20_heavy_artillery.png"><img src="../../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/20_heavy_artillery.png"/></a> Heavy Artillery</h5>
<p>Bomb damage is increased by 200% – but the number of <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> in slots is decreased by 50%. This does not apply to <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> which deal no damage.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> For any bomb causing pain on your foe, the number you carry is halved, but the damage is doubled. This allows you to drop a well-aimed bomb on a large enemy or group of foes, and really decimate them with a single strike. The downside is if you miss! In addition, as this takes up an Ability slot, you may find that lobbing two <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> of regular damage is just as effective (and doesn’t require you to purchase this skill). However, if you’re wishing to clear a battlefields of enemies with a single bomb, or wish your <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> did greater damage (and you end up having some left over after each <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>), pick this skill, then augment it by working at your Corvo Bianco <a href="../../inventory-data/alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a> Lab (when unlocked, which adds one to each bomb count), as well as Efficiency and Cluster <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="Bombs">Bombs</a> from the <a href="../../inventory-data/alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a> Tree that help increase your bomb number and potency, too.</p>
<h5><a href="../../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/21_relentless_attack.png"><img src="../../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/21_relentless_attack.png"/></a> Relentless Attack</h5>
<p>Each defensive action generates Adrenaline Points: Parries 0.1 points, Counterattacks 0.4 points, Dodges 0.3 points, Leaps 0.2 points. Cannot be activated more than once every 5 seconds.</p>

<td class="Basic-Table"><strong class="Body-bold">Points in branch needed to unlock: 0</strong></td>

<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> If you’re the type of Witcher who tends to try a more defensive strategy when facing bandits and <a href="../../inventory-data/monsters.html" title="monsters">monsters</a>, and find you’re running out of Adrenaline Points, then give this ability a try. Though its biggest downside is its activation delay (once every five seconds), having a quicker regeneration of Adrenaline Points is always helpful. This allows you to use the enemy’s attacks against them; Countering and claiming almost half an AP at the same time! Obviously, Counters and Dodges are the best way to increase your AP with this Ability as they have the highest partial-point number, so focus on those instead of Parrying. This forces you to perfect Counters, and therefore keeps you effective in <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> for longer. However, you may have other ways to keep your APs up, making this Ability unnecessary.</p>
<h5><a href="../../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/02_sun_stars.png"><img src="../../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/02_sun_stars.png"/></a> Sun And Stars</h5>
<p>During the day, Vitality regenerates by an additional 10 points per second when not in <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>. At night, Stamina regenerates by an additional 1 point per second during <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> This is useful to start with, and especially so when attempting the Blood and Broken Bones! Or Death March! difficulty modes. The additional boosts to health and Stamina regeneration can be the difference between success and failure. However, your Vitality can regenerate fully when you Meditate, and the time of day means this isn’t a constant regeneration of Stamina. A better plan is a fool-proof plan of purchasing abilities for a particular character archetype, and using <a href="../../inventory-data/potions.html" title="Potions">Potions</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> Useful earlier rather than later into your adventure, this is mainly utilized by those investing heavily in <a href="../combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a>, in conjunction with the Rage Management General ability (which allows you to cast <a href="../combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> using Adrenaline Points). <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a>/Sign <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/bestiary/hybrids.html" title="hybrids">hybrids</a>, who wish to use Ursine gear (with Adrenaline bonuses) but also employ <a href="../combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> may also find this helpful. In the field, this simply allows you to cast <a href="../combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> more frequently in <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>. As you gain experience however, this becomes less helpful as your later Sign abilities tend to allow Stamina regeneration without the need for waiting, which is what this ability circumvents.</p>

<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> Adrenaline, under ideal circumstances, only gets used up when you make use of an ability that requires it. Focus allows Adrenaline that isn’t being used to increase your weapon damage and Sign intensity, effectively giving you free additional <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> potential. It can also be combined with Battle Frenzy (a General ability listed previously) so that the Battle Trance passive bonuses are</p>
<p>applied, along with the ones for Battle Frenzy. Though there are ways to increase weapons damage and Sign intensity by other means (the Sign Branches’ “Intensity” abilities that can increase Sign Intensity by far more than Focus), this is worth considering.</p>

<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> Though helpful in the early days of your adventuring, you should be focusing on abilities that stack with each other, and offer a constant regeneration of Adrenaline, Vitality, or Stamina.

Why not invest in Quen’s Exploding Shield instead? Improve your <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> prowess so foes find it harder to whittle down your Vitality!</p>

<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> If you are focusing on a character that uses the Strong Attacks from the <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a> Branch of the Ability Tree, and also require a higher Vitality (which you can add more to using Green <a href="../../inventory-data/mutagens.html" title="Mutagens">Mutagens</a>), this is a key ability and utilized time and time again for those wanting to wear (and gain the added benefits of) Heavy <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>. This bonus can get extremely high, as there are four pieces of <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> to wear (torso, <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/gloves.html" title="gloves">gloves</a>, trousers, and <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/boots.html" title="boots">boots</a>). Remember that the Runewright’s Glyphword “Heft” causes any <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> to be treated as Heavy <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>, if you want to mix and match equipment but still use this bonus.</p>

<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> This forms the foundation of many different archetypes, and should be seriously considered in almost every adventure. Partner this ability with other elements that increase your Adrenaline Points, such as Razor Focus or Ursine Witcher gear. Or Whirl, which actually generates Adrenaline Points! Then simply let rip with any and all <a href="../combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a>, and continue to cast (using Adrenaline) when your Stamina is depleted! With a number of methods of maintaining a reservoir of Adrenaline, you may never run out of Sign power again! Feel free to continuously light foes on fire with Igni, or cause damage while defending yourself with Quen Active Shield, with fewer worries about lacking Sign-casting capabilities. This is tremendous help for hybrid or <a href="../combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> archetypes, and even pure <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a> builds benefit (as you should have a healthy Adrenaline Point regeneration, allowing both swordplay and <a href="../combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> without rest!).</p>

<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> Are you wearing Medium <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> (or using the Glyphword “Balance” that allows any <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> to be treated as Medium <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>)? Does your character specialize primarily in magic that requires an impressive Sign intensity and Stamina regeneration? Then this is a must-have ability! Choose this as soon as possible, then find four pieces of medium <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> (torso, <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/gloves.html" title="gloves">gloves</a>, trousers, and <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/boots.html" title="boots">boots</a>) to wear. This offers large and easy to obtain bonuses and should be the cornerstone of a mage-style archetype.</p>

<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> If you’re utilizing a <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a>-centric archetype and paying particular attention to Fast attacks, as well as scoring critical hits, then this is an exceptional ability, and the cornerstone of a build. It offers immediate and multiple bonuses (with only one ability point expended!), as long as you’re clad in Light <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>, such as the Feline torso, <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/gloves.html" title="gloves">gloves</a>, trousers, and <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/boots.html" title="boots">boots</a>. Alternatively, have the Runewright enchant the Levity Glyphword, turning any <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> you’re wearing into Light <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>, which also enables this ability.</p>

<p><strong class="Body-bold">Notes:</strong> You may find partnering the Marksmanship <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a> Abilities, which also augment your crossbow, more helpful as you can place them with <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a> Abilities for Mutagen bonuses, whereas this is a stand-alone ability. While it’s helpful to tag a foe at range in fewer hits, especially when using <a href="../../inventory-data/bolts.html" title="bolts">bolts</a> that you only have a finite supply of, the fact that there’s an infinite supply of <a href="../../inventory-data/bolts.html" title="bolts">bolts</a> means shots may not need to count in most situations. If you want to be the ultimate huntsman though, this is a good ability to add.</p>
