<p>As you explore the world, <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/carnal-knowledge/locations.html" title="locations">locations</a> are revealed and marked on your map. As you pass by, your mini-map identifies the <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/carnal-knowledge/locations.html" title="locations">locations</a> of <a href="../inventory-data/herbs.html" title="herbs">herbs</a> as you pass them. Enemy positions (picture 1) are also marked (including the positions where they fell—an “x” mark—to allow for finding and looting the corpses), as well as stairwells and important cave entrances, merchant <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/carnal-knowledge/locations.html" title="locations">locations</a>, and quest objective waypoints (picture 2).</p>

<h4>Discovering A Point Of Interest</h4>
<p>Points of Interest cover a wide variety of <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/carnal-knowledge/locations.html" title="locations">locations</a> (and types of <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/carnal-knowledge/locations.html" title="locations">locations</a>) in the world, including special events, battles, or hidden treasures that can help increase Geralt’s strength, line his coffers with crowns to use to better equip himself, or contain <a href="../inventory-data/diagrams/crafting-component-diagrams.html" title="diagrams">diagrams</a> and formulae for better <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>, weapons, <a href="../inventory-data/potions.html" title="potions">potions</a>, or sword <a href="../inventory-data/oils.html" title="oils">oils</a>. Most Points of Interest appear on the World Map as a large “?” question mark after Geralt overhears interesting information from townsfolk, or reads about a location on a Notice Board, flyer posted to a wall, or obtains special maps from a vendor (when adventuring across the isles of <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/skellige.html" title="Skellige">Skellige</a>). It is then up to you to decide whether or not to travel to those <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/carnal-knowledge/locations.html" title="locations">locations</a> and discover what’s there. It’s also possible to stumble upon a Point of Interest with no prior knowledge of its existence.</p>
<p>Exploring Points of Interest can not only fatten Geralt’s coin purse and inventory, but he also gains experience once a POI is explored and any problems at the location are solved, and/or treasure is looted. It’s in your best interest to take the time and explore the world, and visit all these Points of Interest.</p>
<h3>Points Of Interest: Types (World Map)</h3>
<p>This section details all the different Points of Interest you can discover on your travels. These all appear on your World Map, and can be toggled “on” or “off.” Most important are Signposts, after which all other POIs are presented in alphabetical order. They are also tracked throughout the <a href="../atlas/using-the-atlas.html" title="Atlas">Atlas</a> section of this guide. Interactive versions appear on the free digital guide <a href="../atlas/using-the-atlas.html" title="Atlas">Atlas</a> maps that accompany this tome.</p>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Fade To Grey: Clearing Out And Visiting Locations</h3>
<p class="Tip">As you progress throughout <a href="../videos/treasure-hunts/velen.html" title="Velen">Velen</a> and beyond, and wish to visit and clear out as many <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/carnal-knowledge/locations.html" title="locations">locations</a> as possible as you go, be sure to check your World Map once you are about to leave a location. When you have killed all the enemies, and looted all the chests of note at a particular location, the marker usually turns grey. This doesn’t occur for icons such as boats (obviously), but for <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/carnal-knowledge/locations.html" title="locations">locations</a> such as <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/places-of-power.html" title="Places of Power">Places of Power</a>, Monster Dens and Nests, and Guarded Treasure; you can easily keep track of what you’ve visited by making sure everything is grey when you finally step away!</p>

<h3>Learn The Customs: Make Your Mark On The Map!</h3>

</a>
</p>
<p class="Note">It is extremely useful, when navigating the World Map, to employ the Custom Marker tool. This allows you to place a marker (shown) anywhere you like. As this icon shows up on your mini-map, it can be utilized as a waypoint to an unexplored area to more easily reach it. Simply look at a location you haven’t found using this guide’s <a href="../atlas/using-the-atlas.html" title="Atlas">Atlas</a>, plot a Custom Marker at the approximate location, and go exploring! Hold the Custom Waypoint Button and pop-up containing additional custom waypoints appears. You can place a total of 10 of these icons on the map. This is particularly helpful for finding all the <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/places-of-power.html" title="Places of Power">Places of Power</a>, but can be used any time you like!</p>

<p>Important <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/carnal-knowledge/locations.html" title="locations">locations</a> across the Northern Realms are usually marked by signposts, both on your maps and by a physical signpost placed somewhere in that location. These signposts act as a Fast Travel network that you can use to more swiftly move from one location to another. This can significantly cut down on travel times, particularly during quests that span entire regions. However, you can only fast-travel to signposts you have already discovered (either by visiting them already, or by reading a map you’ve bought or found). Think of Signposts as anchor points across the Northern Realms; explore around each of them to discover other Points of Interest, and then find more signposts so you can perfect your fast-travel network.</p>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Oceans Apart: Fast-Travel Across Water</h3>
<p class="Tip">One example where fast-travel proves invaluable is when you’re navigating the seas around <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/skellige.html" title="Skellige">Skellige</a>. Instead of braving an ocean each time you navigate to another island, open your World Map and pick an already-known harbor as your destination. While you have to travel by ocean to each of the islands once, you don’t need to do it again and again! The only downside is when you wish to set sail to one of the many tinier islands that have no signpost; then you’re at the mercy of the seas and your boating skills!</p>

<p>Also known as “Abandoned Settlements,” these are <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/carnal-knowledge/locations.html" title="locations">locations</a> where the usual peasantry are nowhere to be seen. Shrines left abandoned after <a href="../inventory-data/monsters.html" title="monsters">monsters</a> took interest; logging mills overrun by bandits; villages plundered by soldiers—all of these are examples of settlements or landmarks that have been left to rot in the hands (or claws) of those who usurped them from the innocent. If you can clear these <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/carnal-knowledge/locations.html" title="locations">locations</a> of all danger, the people will return, rewarding you for your efforts. Reclaiming (also known as “liberating”) abandoned sites can open up new merchants, blacksmiths, or armorers to purchase goods and services from. Additionally, each reclaimed settlement awards an experience point bonus, as well as a fistful of crowns. For a definite enemy fight, followed by a possible vendor appearance and money reward, seek these settlements out.</p>
<h4><a href="../../media/alchemy_supplies.png"><img src="../../media/alchemy_supplies.png"/></a> Alchemists and Alchemy Supplies</h4>

<p>This location, usually a building within a hamlet or village, has a supplier of <a href="../inventory-data/alchemy.html" title="alchemy">alchemy</a> ingredients for you to use in your crafting. As the current political situation has forced many of these vendors to flee or ply their trade underground, don’t expect a large number of these merchant types. This trader almost certainly is a <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> player too.

<p>Also known as “Workbenches,” Armorer’s tables are usually found near Grindstones, and both are situated close to a Blacksmith or Armorer within a settlement. Simply walk up to a table, and use it to grant your gear increased <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> for a limited duration. This is where to go to get a boost before a tough fight.</p>

<p>As the war between Redania and Nilfgaard drives on, deserters or common thugs have seen an increase in numbers, forming roaming gangs that attack travelers, usually on the roads between villages. Some of these gangs are organized enough to have set up camps to rest, recuperate, and divide the loot of the day. Entering these camps unprepared can be a fatal mistake, even for a Witcher, as you must face off with large numbers of bandits who wish to keep their camp a secret for as long as possible. Of course, dead men tell no tales! You are encouraged to remove this threat, as the spoils that can be gained from killing all the bandits and looting the camp are potentially quite lucrative, and can occasionally lead to the discovery of a quest.</p>
<h4><a href="../../media/barber.png"><img src="../../media/barber.png"/></a> Barber</h4>
<p>Visit a barber for a shave (usually costing five crowns) or a new haircut (usually costing 10 crowns). Look for the large scissors both on your World Map, but also hanging as a sign above a Barbershop door. Unlike most traders, Barbers don’t concern themselves with <a href="../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> playing.</p>

<p>This signifies an interior or underground area, either a location that is primarily man-made (signified in the guide with a Temple icon) or naturally-occurring (signified in the guide with a Cave icon). Dungeons have their own cartography appearing on your mini-map, and are sometimes labyrinthine in nature. If you come across a Dungeon on your travels, be sure to consult the <a href="../atlas/using-the-atlas.html" title="Atlas">Atlas</a> so you know how deep and intricate the area is. Some Dungeons are part of Signposted areas, while others have their own unique names.</p>

<p>Also known as “Sharpening Stones”, Grindstones are usually found near to Armorer’s Tables, and both are situated close to a Blacksmith or Armorer, within a settlement. Simply walk up to a Grindstone, and use it to grant your weapons an increase in its sharpness (allowing for more damage to be dealt for a short while).

<p>Sometimes shipments of goods or treasures are lost between villages. The reasons for this are numerous, but bandits or <a href="../inventory-data/monsters.html" title="monsters">monsters</a> have become the distressingly common cause. You may hear about such loot as you pass through the villages of the Northern Realms, and may even feel inclined to investigate this personally. The bandits or <a href="../inventory-data/monsters.html" title="monsters">monsters</a> can be found surrounding the item of interest (usually a chest or corpse with treasure of reasonable value); and it stands to reason that they must be forcibly removed before you can claim the goods for yourself.</p>

<p>You also come across information about treasures hidden in various parts of the wilderness, left forgotten to the world. In these instances, it is simply a matter of finding the treasure and claiming it to resolve these Points of Interest. Usually, the place where hidden treasure is indicated on the map has a small area of investigation. This leads to a clue (and sometimes a key) to the whereabouts of the actual treasure, and a small quest begins until the treasure is found. There are well over 40 of these secret <a href="../treasure-hunts/overview.html" title="Treasure Hunts">Treasure Hunts</a>, and all with a related quest are revealed in the Treasure Hunt chapter of this guide.</p>
<p>In addition, some Hidden Treasures start much more involved <a href="../scavenger-hunts/viper-school-gear/serpentine-steel-sword-kolgrims-comeuppance.html" title="Scavenger Hunts">Scavenger Hunts</a>, which always uncover a wealth of written materials, clues, and other information regarding a different Witcher School, and its associated gear. These more involved <a href="../scavenger-hunts/viper-school-gear/serpentine-steel-sword-kolgrims-comeuppance.html" title="Scavenger Hunts">Scavenger Hunts</a> are detailed later in this guide.</p>
<p>Finally, there may be occasional Hidden Treasure that doesn’t start either a Treasure Hunt or Scavenger Hunt quest. Simply find the icon on the map, and the treasure will be nearby.</p>

<p>Nekkers, Ghouls and Alghouls, Rotfiends, Drowners, Harpies, and Endrega are some of the most common threats that plague the land, and they tend to be the most aggressive at colonizing new regions to build nests.

As one might expect, <a href="../inventory-data/monsters.html" title="monsters">monsters</a> guard their nests ferociously.

<p>In some bandit camps, and occasionally in rural spots across the Northern Realms, you may encounter a prisoner locked in a holding cage. Freeing these folk—almost always after delivering a series of killing blows to their captors and looting the cage key from the captor leader—may result in rewards. In some cases, the prisoners are actually merchants, armorers, or blacksmiths, who then return to their home villages and offer you their services at a reduced rate, as thanks for the rescue.</p>

<p>Three large-scale fortifications (Tulasens Caves, Arthach Palace Ruins, and Mont Crane Castle) have been overrun by an outlaw gang of bandits, who have Bandit Camps (and sometimes Knight Errants in Distress and Abandoned Sites) surrounding this central stronghold. They are armed-to-the-teeth, number in the dozens, and can call upon reinforcements if you let a torch-carrying bandit light a signal fire at this location. Clear the Hanse of all foes (Bandits, Hanse Dogs, and </p>
<p>the bandit leader), and expect the Knights Errant to arrive to secure the area (and an armorer or blacksmith to offer deep discounts depending on the location). You can also claim a reward (100 crowns) from the Duchy Camerlengo for each Outlaw Hanse you wipe out.</p>
