<p>It is important to understand that Geralt himself isn’t skilled in the arts of armorsmithing or blacksmithing; he can only repair the equipment he wears or wields (or he can get others to repair equipment for him). For improvements and creating new <a href="./combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> items, he must rely on the numerous smiths scattered across the Northern Realms. There are two kinds of smith, and both offer specialized services. Armorers can craft, sell, and repair <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>. Blacksmiths are focused on weapons. Remember though, that both smiths usually have both <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> and weapons for sale, and can repair both <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> and weaponry. But only Armorers can craft new <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>, and only Blacksmiths can craft new weapons.</p>
<figure class="full"><a href="../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/TRAINING01_131.jpg"> <img src="../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/TRAINING01_131.jpg"/> </a> <figcaption> <figcaption>A swordsmith (known by the general title “Blacksmith”) hammers away at an anvil in the second city of Oxenfurt. Visit any of these fine fellows to repair, dismantle, or upgrade your equipment.</figcaption> </figcaption></figure>
<p>Almost all Armorers and Blacksmiths have two levels of talent; either Amateur or Journeyman. Amateur smiths can craft the most basic of items. Journeyman smiths can craft more impressive equipment. In addition, a single Armorer and a single Blacksmith offer skilled services at the fabled Master level (these are listed below): Remember, not all Armorers and Blacksmiths are equal. Many can work on a specific quality of gear and <a href="../inventory-data/diagrams/crafting-component-diagrams.html" title="diagrams">diagrams</a>, so you need to be mindful of a smith’s competence level. If they don’t have the necessary experience, they won’t be able to work with a crafting diagram you found. Also note that if a village is missing a smith, it is likely they have been kidnapped, and are a Person in Distress, caged nearby and waiting to be rescued by you.</p>
<h3><a href="../../media/blacksmith.png"><img src="../../media/blacksmith.png"/></a> Crafting: Armorers And Blacksmiths</h3>
<h4>Finding Crafting Diagrams</h4>
<p>In order to craft new or improved equipment, you must have a specific Crafting Diagram in your possession. While certain Merchants have these for sale, the majority of the highest-quality <a href="../inventory-data/diagrams/crafting-component-diagrams.html" title="diagrams">diagrams</a> are found during quests, especially the Witcher Gear Scavenger Hunt. Random Crafting <a href="../inventory-data/diagrams/crafting-component-diagrams.html" title="Diagrams">Diagrams</a> are also found on corpses and looted from chests. A full list of vendors who sell Crafting <a href="../inventory-data/diagrams/crafting-component-diagrams.html" title="Diagrams">Diagrams</a>, and their competence level (Amateur, Journeyman, or Master) can be found in the Merchants Appendix.</p>
<figure class="full"><a href="../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/TRAINING01_132.jpg"> <img src="../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/TRAINING01_132.jpg"/> </a> <figcaption> <figcaption>Find Crafting <a href="../inventory-data/diagrams/crafting-component-diagrams.html" title="Diagrams">Diagrams</a> for powerful weapons and quality <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> while adventuring across the Northern Realms.</figcaption> </figcaption></figure>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Example: Feline Armor (Part 1)</h3>
<p class="Tip">You recently undertook the Scavenger Hunt: <a href="../scavenger-hunts/cat-school-gear/preamble-maps-from-the-adjunct-mapper-adalbert-kermith.html" title="Cat School Gear">Cat School Gear</a>, and were lucky enough to discover a Crafting Diagram for Feline <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>. As you’re currently over Level 17 (and thus able to wear this <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>), and want the <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> increase and stamina regeneration this light <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> gives you, you decide to visit the armorer in the village of Mulbrydale. This chap was previously a Person in Distress whom you rescued from some riverside bandits southwest of the village. After waiting for him to return to his anvil, you ask him to craft something for you. Unfortunately, even though you rescued him, and he’s giving you a good deal on purchases and crafting, he is only an Amateur Armorer. A Journeyman Armorer is needed to craft Feline <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>, and this chap isn’t competent enough. Curses!</p>
</aside>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Example: Feline Armor (Part 2)</h3>
<p class="Tip">Leaving Mulbrydale and that low-quality anvil-hammering halfwit, you journey to the City of <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/novigrad.html" title="Novigrad">Novigrad</a>, and visit the open-air fish market just south of Hierarch Square. Nestled in one corner is a Blacksmith’s. Even though it’s midday, the place is empty. Perhaps the smith has gone for lunch? After you Meditate for two hours, the smith opens back up for business. As you’ve checked his credentials on the Merchant Appendix of this guide, you know he’s a Journeyman Blacksmith, so you ask him to craft you some Feline <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>. Alas, he can’t—he’s a Blacksmith and only forges weapons! Curses again!</p>
</aside>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Example: Feline Armor (Part 3)</h3>
<p class="Tip">Let’s find the correct smith this time! Up the covered walkway from the Vivaldi Bank in Hierarch Square (<a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/novigrad.html" title="Novigrad">Novigrad</a> City) is the Armorer you seek; a Journeyman with the correct requirements for crafting the Feline <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> from the diagram. The only problem now? You don’t have all the crafting components! Triple curses!</p>
</aside>
<h4>Finding Crafting Materials</h4>
<p>In addition to needing a Crafting Diagram to construct a new piece of <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> or weapon, a smith also requires a number of material components to work together into the finished product. These materials are scattered throughout the Northern Realms, and are gathered in a number of ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="Body-bold">Crafting: </strong>Some materials you find are known as Crafting Components, and a smith can craft them into a new material you need for a more intricate item. For example, Assassin’s <a href="../inventory-data/armor/boots.html" title="Boots">Boots</a> require Cured Leather (1) as one of the materials. Check your Inventory for Leather Scraps you may have acquired on your adventure; four units of Leather Scraps can be crafted into one Cured Leather component. Crafting Components are usually rough metal ores, string and thread, timber, or other base materials.</li>
<li><strong class="Body-bold">Dismantling: </strong>One of the options each smith has is to dismantle items you are carrying in your inventory. Simply select the item, pay the smith, and reduce the item to its base components to be subsequently combined into new equipment. Before you do this, check the price you pay for dismantling compared to that of simply purchasing the base components, or simply selling the item instead; it might be a better investment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong class="Body-bold">Loot: </strong>Pilfer from abandoned houses, dungeons, hostile <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/carnal-knowledge/locations.html" title="locations">locations</a>, and even areas where friendly peasants live, as long as the receptacle isn’t guarded.</li>
<li><strong class="Body-bold">Purchase: </strong>If you have the funds, you can visit any Merchant (but primarily Armorers and Blacksmiths have what you need), look through their wares, and buy the necessary material. This is a much more expensive option.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Example: Feline Armor (Part 4)</h3>
<p class="Tip"><a href="../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/101241.jpg"> <img src="../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/101241.jpg"/> </a></p>
<p class="Tip">Feline <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> has five different components to gather before crafting to begin. There’s Hardened Timber (2), Shirt (1), Powdered Monster Tissue (1), Hardened Leather (2), and Dark Steel Plate (2).</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong class="Body-bold">Hardened Timber (2):</strong> You found three units of Timber while searching a lumber mill in the wilds of <a href="../videos/treasure-hunts/velen.html" title="Velen">Velen</a>. You had a spare crossbow, and had the Armorer disassemble it for the fourth Timber component. You purchased two units of Resin from the Armorer. This gives you: Timber (4) and Resin (2). You go to the Crafting Components section of the Armorer’s Crafting Menu, and look up “Hardened Timber”. Then you craft your components to make Hardened Timber (2).</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong class="Body-bold">Shirt (1):</strong> You took a shirt of a bandit in a past scuffle. Time to use it!</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong class="Body-bold">Powdered Monster Tissue (1):</strong> You received Specter Dust from a fight with a Noonwraith. The Armorer is happy to Dismantle it for you, transforming it into the Powdered Monster Tissue you need.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong class="Body-bold">Hardened Leather (2):</strong> You’ve picked up some <a href="../inventory-data/horse.html" title="Horse">Horse</a> Hide (2) on your travels. Though seen as Junk, the Armorer is happy to Dismantle it into Hardened Leather and Leather Scraps for you.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong class="Body-bold">Dark Steel Plate (2):</strong> A rummage around various mines in <a href="../videos/treasure-hunts/velen.html" title="Velen">Velen</a> has yielded both Steel Ingots (4) and Dark Iron Ore (8). At the Armorer’s Crafting menu, you can combine them in the Crafting Component section to craft Dark Steel Ingots (4). Two Dark Steel Ingots are needed to Craft into one Dark Steel Plate. When done twice, you have both the Dark Steel Plates you need.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong class="Body-bold">Feline <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>:</strong> Finally! After paying your crowns, the Journeyman Armorer crafts this fancy piece of torso <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> for you. Of course, now you start the search for the components to create the Feline <a href="../inventory-data/armor/boots.html" title="Boots">Boots</a>, Trousers, and <a href="../inventory-data/armor/gloves.html" title="Gloves">Gloves</a> to complete the set!</p>
<p class="Tip">Using the Witcher’s Tools onlne is most helpful in learning exactly what components to dismantle. In addition, the Merchant’s Appendix enables you to see the “Type” of item every single Merchant sells (Junk, Upgrades, etc.), allowing you to peruse for specific items more easily.</p>
</aside>
<h4>Master Crafting Diagrams And Gear</h4>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the ultimate in <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> and weaponry is available when you find Crafting <a href="../inventory-data/diagrams/crafting-component-diagrams.html" title="Diagrams">Diagrams</a> that require Master level smiths to craft. These are the very best <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> sets and swords you can obtain. For this to happen, you must visit the shop of the previously-listed armorers and smiths who offer equipment of the highest quality. However, some have an involved quest to complete first:</p>
<p><strong class="Body-bold">Yoana (Master Armorer):</strong> Visit Yoana, over at Crow’s Perch in <a href="../videos/treasure-hunts/velen.html" title="Velen">Velen</a>, and complete Secondary Quest: <a href="../secondary-quests/master-armorers/nonsense-skellige-legends.html" title="Master Armorers">Master Armorers</a>. Afterward, her shop and services become available.</p>
<p><strong class="Body-bold">Eibhear Hattori (Master Blacksmith):</strong> Visit Hattori over at his Dumpling Shop in <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/novigrad.html" title="Novigrad">Novigrad</a> City, and complete Secondary Quest: <a href="../secondary-quests/of-swords-and-dumplings/kneading-dough-not-forging-steel.html" title="Of Swords and Dumplings">Of Swords and Dumplings</a>. Afterward, his shop and services become available.</p>

Their shops and services are immediately available.</p>
<p><strong class="Body-bold"><a href="../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/HoS_icon6.png"><img src="../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/HoS_icon6.png"/></a> Master Armorer and Blacksmith:</strong> Visit <a href="./the-ofieri-runewright.html" title="the Ofieri Runewright">the Ofieri Runewright</a> at Upper Mill (Gustfields), and complete Hearts of Stone: Secondary Quest: Enchanting (all three requests for money). For each amount of funding you give him, he can craft Amateur, Journeyman, and finally Master level <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> and weapons, acting as both Armorer and Blacksmith.</p>
<p><strong class="Body-bold"><a href="../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/BaW_icon7.png"><img src="../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/BaW_icon7.png"/></a> Grandmaster Armorer and Blacksmith:</strong> Visit Lazare Lafargue at his Beauclair shop. It is immediately open and he can craft master-level <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> and weapons immediately. For Grandmaster <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> (which is only relevant to Witcher gear), the Witcher Gear <a href="../scavenger-hunts/viper-school-gear/serpentine-steel-sword-kolgrims-comeuppance.html" title="Scavenger Hunts">Scavenger Hunts</a> for <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/toussaint.html" title="Toussaint">Toussaint</a> must be completed. Afterward, Grandmaster <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> and weapons for Feline, Griffin, Ursine, Wolven, and Manticore School equipment can be crafted!</p>

</aside>
<h4>Crafting &gt; Crafting</h4>
<p>This Armorer and Blacksmith menu allows you to craft the following <a href="../inventory-data/diagrams/crafting-component-diagrams.html" title="diagrams">diagrams</a>: <a href="../inventory-data/armor/boots.html" title="Boots">Boots</a>, Chest <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>, Crafting Components, <a href="../inventory-data/crossbows.html" title="Crossbows">Crossbows</a>, Gauntlets (<a href="../inventory-data/armor/gloves.html" title="Gloves">Gloves</a>), Junk, Silver Swords, Steel Swords, Trousers, and Upgrades.</p>
<h4>Crafting &gt; Repair</h4>
<p>This Armorer and Blacksmith menu allows you to pay to have your equipment repaired. Single items, or every damaged item you own (at once), can be repaired, if you have the funds. This is also a quick way to see your damaged items in one place.</p>
<aside class="Note">
<h3>Damaged Equipment: Hammer Time</h3>
<p class="Note">Note that any piece of equipment that is damaged has a small hammer icon attached to it.</p>

<h4>Crafting &gt; Remove Upgrades</h4>

Check the section on Upgrades for a list of the different (and recommended) <a href="../inventory-data/glyphs.html" title="Glyphs">Glyphs</a> and <a href="../inventory-data/runestones.html" title="Runestones">Runestones</a>. Only you can add these augmentations to your equipment. Only a smith can remove them (and the <a href="../inventory-data/glyphs.html" title="glyphs">glyphs</a> and <a href="../inventory-data/runestones.html" title="runestones">runestones</a> are destroyed in the process). Do this when you wish to change the benefits of a glyph or runestone, or you find a better quality glyph or runestone.</p>
<h4>Crafting &gt; Dismantle</h4>

<p>As previously discussed, an Armorer or Blacksmith can dismantle a number of your equipment types into base materials so you can recreate other (and hopefully better) equipment. Use this menu to see the components that are created, too. The following item types can be dismantled (at either smith): Witcher Gear, <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>, Swords, Upgrades, Tools, Junk, Crafting Components, <a href="../inventory-data/alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a> Ingredients, and Food and Drink.</p>
<p>Dismantling is an incredibly useful function of all smiths; you’ll get nowhere with Crafting if you try to buy all the materials yourself. It is best to salvage what you can from equipment left behind by fallen foes, or from older weapons that are no longer of use to you, or from junk acquired during your travels.</p>
<p>If you visit the Duchy of <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/toussaint.html" title="Toussaint">Toussaint</a>, and uncover a hidden <a href="../inventory-data/alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a> Laboratory under the Corvo Bianco Vineyard as part of Blood and Wine Secondary Quest: No Place Like Home, you can dismantle items for free!</p>
<h3>Repairing Items: Durability</h3>
<p>Swords dull, <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> bends and breaks. As each item wears down, it loses value and becomes less effective. Hiring a properly skilled smith to repair the item can fully restore its durability. Remember that Armorers and Blacksmiths can repair every single damaged piece of <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> and weaponry with one choice, if you have the funds: Simply ask to see their wares, back out of the Shop to the Crafting &gt; Repair menu, and choose “Repair All”. Additionally, <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> and weapon repair kits can be purchased or crafted to help maintain gear in the field.</p>
<p>Some armorers and blacksmiths also have Armorer Tables and Grindstones that provide time-limited bonuses to <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> and weapon damage respectively, when used.</p>
<h5>The Importance Of Maintenance</h5>
<p>Pay attention to the condition of your equipment! Deteriorated swords strike for considerably less damage, while low durability <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> does not protect Geralt as well as maintained <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>. A smith can fully restore a piece of equipment, and it is possible to use a repair kit to restore items in the field.</p>
<h5>Armorers Tables And Grindstones</h5>
<figure class="full"><a href="../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/TRAINING01_141.jpg"> <img src="../../media/files/004-091_characters-how-to-training-web-resources/image/TRAINING01_141.jpg"/> </a></figure>
<p>Armorers Tables (also known as Workbenches) and Grindstones (also known as Whetstones or Sharpening Stones) can be found next to some smiths or in villages. You can use these to provide temporary boosts to your equipment’s effectiveness (<a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> is enhanced at a table, and weapons are enhanced at grindstones). Both are indicated on your maps once you pass near them. This is where to go to get a boost before a tough fight.</p>
<h5>Do It Yourself: Armor And Weapon Repair Kits</h5>
<p>A well-used sword gradually deteriorates and the damage inflicted lessens. <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> employed in battle gradually weakens and damage resistance lessens. This is your <a href="./combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> equipment’s Durability rating, and is the most important statistic after its <a href="./combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> potential. By visiting an Amateur, Journeyman, or Master Armorer or Blacksmith, you can Repair any of your <a href="./combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> items. But why not do it yourself?</p>
<p>Repair Kits (<a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> and Weapon varieties) are accessible at any time once you buy one, as it is part of your Inventory. It is weighty though, so you may wish to return to a Stash and keep your Repair Kits there (or on Roach). Simply highlight the Repair Kit you wish to use, then the <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> or weapon you wish to repair, and repair it. The quality of the Repair Kit influences the percentage amount you can add to your Durability. Amateur (15%), Journeyman (40%), and Master (90%) repair kits are available.</p>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Repair Kit Example: Mending Some Armor</h3>
<p class="Tip">For example, Geralt’s Verden archer’s gambeson has seen better days, and is damaged with only 20% Durability left. He uses two Amateur Repair Kits, increasing the Durability to 50% (15% x 2). He then uses a Journeyman Repair Kit to increase the Durability to 90%. That should be fine for a few more battles! Note that if he used a single Master Repair Kit, the <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>’s durability would increase to 100%, but 10% of the Repair Kit’s improvement would be “wasted”. So Geralt would have waited until the Gambeson was at 10% Durability or seen the wasted amount as a worthwhile compromise.</p>

<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Keep Weapon Repair Kits Handy!</h3>
<p class="Tip">Avoid having to go to an armorer or blacksmith to repair your weapons and <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> by keeping a supply of repair kits available. We recommend favoring a larger number of Weapon Repair Kits compared to <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>. Ideally, you shouldn’t allow anything to hit your <a href="../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>, while your sword should be making multiple contacts with the enemy.</p>
