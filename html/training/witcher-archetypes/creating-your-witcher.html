<p>The key to creating an entertaining, flexible, and powerful Archetype is to focus on the type of ways you like to survive and fight.</p>
<h3>Overall Archetype</h3>
<p>If you’re purely interested in using swords (and to a lesser extent, the crossbow), look primarily at <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a> Archetypes with a couple of General Abilities. If you enjoy using magic against foes, <a href="../combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> are the way to go. Should you feel the need to concoct <a href="../../inventory-data/potions.html" title="potions">potions</a>, <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a>, <a href="../../inventory-data/decoctions.html" title="decoctions">decoctions</a>, and <a href="../../inventory-data/oils.html" title="oils">oils</a>, focus on an <a href="../../inventory-data/alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a> build. If you’re intending on adventuring at a higher difficulty, pick a Hybrid build where two (or more) Ability branches are chosen.</p>
<h3>Statistical Prowess And Complementary Elements</h3>
<p>The key to becoming a legend across the Northern Realms is to be very, very good at one particular aspect of fighting. Initially, that’s usually focusing on Fast Attack Abilities to out-perform enemies you fight against. But that is only the beginning! You should read about all the different abilities, and research how they affect each other, and how the vast array of items you gather can also bolster your statistics.</p>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Example: The Hard-Hitting Combat Machine</h3>
<p class="Tip">The Archetype examples are geared to improving a variety of different sets of statistics that are imperative to bolster, but just one of these would be Adrenaline Point gains (which allows for harder-hitting attacks and other <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> benefits); at the most basic level, you may decide having as many Adrenaline Points as possible would be beneficial (and it is!).</p>
</aside>
<p>The first step is looking through all the Ability branches to see which abilities add to your Adrenaline: Each <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a> Ability gives you a 1% gain no matter what ability it is. Blows landed during <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> generate Adrenaline Points and each one increases weapon damage by 10%. Strong Attacks and Battle Trance Abilities are particularly focused on Adrenaline Point (AP) management, and some effects work well with other abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold">Rend (<a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a>)</strong> has other effects, but it also enables APs to increase total damage by 33-100%.</li>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold">Deadly Precision</strong><strong class="Body-bold">(<a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a>)</strong> allows every AP to add 1% to the chance of instantly killing a foe.</li>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold">Resolve (<a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a>)</strong>lowers AP loss upon taking damage by 20-100%.</li>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold">Undying (<a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a>)</strong> uses APs to restore Vitality instead of death.</li>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold">Razor Focus</strong><strong class="Body-bold">(<a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a>)</strong> gives you an AP for just entering <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>, and increases APs generated by sword attacks by 5-25%.</li>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold">Flood of Anger</strong><strong class="Body-bold">(<a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a>)</strong> allows you to consume APs to upgrade a Sign to its highest level and increase its intensity</li>
</ul>
<p>So Rend and Razor Focus seem to be must-haves (and once you spend 20 points on other Abilities in order to unlock it, you should level it up to 5). In the mean-time, you are finding <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a> Abilities that complement Adrenaline, or use Adrenaline effectively; such as the Fast Attack and Strong Attack branches. Don’t forget to look over the other Ability branches too. Here are some initial picks (which don’t need to be “unlocked” by purchasing other Abilities first):</p>
<ul>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold">Hunter Instinct (<a href="../../inventory-data/alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a>)</strong> allows blades coated with oil (used against an enemy susceptible to the oil) to inflict 20% more critical hit damage, if your APs are at their maximum.</li>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold">Rage Management (General)</strong> allows you to cast <a href="../combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> using APs if your Stamina levels are too low.</li>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold">Adrenaline Burst (General)</strong> increases AP generation by 5% and using <a href="../combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> generates APs.</li>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold">Focus (General)</strong> allows APs to increase weapon damage and Sign intensity.</li>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold"><a href="../../inventory-data/mutagens.html" title="Mutagens">Mutagens</a> (General)</strong> allows you to link Abilities from the same branch for extra bonuses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next plan is to check A Witcher’s Tools, the comprehensive inventory available in the free eGuide, and find items that also help bolster your Adrenaline, before locating them in your adventuring! The following examples are particularly related to Adrenaline:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold">Potion: Maribor Forest</strong> accelerates the generation of Adrenaline Points by 0.15 with extending durations depending on the quality of the Potion.</li>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold">Swords: Ursine <a href="../../inventory-data/steel-and-silver-swords.html" title="Steel and Silver Swords">Steel and Silver Swords</a></strong> both grant you a +5-20% gain in APs, depending on the quality of the weapon.</li>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold"><a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>: Wolven <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a></strong> Torso <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> grants you +5-20% AP gain, while <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/boots.html" title="Boots">Boots</a>, Trousers, and <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/gloves.html" title="Gloves">Gloves</a> increase Attack power.</li>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold">Perun <a href="../../inventory-data/runestones.html" title="Runestones">Runestones</a></strong> are imbued on your weapons, and give between 2-5% AP gain, so three Greater Perun <a href="../../inventory-data/runestones.html" title="Runestones">Runestones</a> grants a single sword with three sockets +15% APs!</li>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold">Replenisment Runewords</strong> allow you to consume an AP after casting a Sign, to charge your sword attack with the power of that Sign.</li>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold">Elation Runewords</strong> give you up to 0.25 Adrenaline Points every time a fatal blow is delivered by the sword this is imbued to.</li>
<li class="Body-BL"><strong class="Body-bold">Placation <a href="../../inventory-data/runestones.html" title="Runestones">Runestones</a></strong> cause your APs to decline once they reach maximum level, in return for increased Stamina and Vitality regeneration, and Toxicity decline.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, learning the items or enchantments to “stack” and utilize together on your character is the key to turning them into a <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> or Sign-conjuring machine! Now learn which elements work in conjunction with one another, and you’ll eventually perfect an Archetype that can handle any battle, in any mode of difficulty! Or just build one of the Archetypes built for Death March! Difficulty instead!</p>
<h3>Levelling Up</h3>
<p>The following Archetypes give you a general selection of <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>, weapons, and abilities you should be finding and unlocking by the time you reach certain levels, in order to keep your Archetype on the right path. There’s no need to follow these guidelines exactly; these are just pointers so you understand what you should be gathering, or the general order of ability points spending on during your adventure.</p>
<h3>Ability Points</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, outside of two quests, there are only two ways to acquire Ability Points; by leveling up and by visiting <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/places-of-power.html" title="Places of Power">Places of Power</a>. There are 30 <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/places-of-power.html" title="Places of Power">Places of Power</a> to locate (though three are only available during the Main Quest, and are therefore important to find during the quests or afterward, and one is in another world, and cannot be returned to!). It is important to read the <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/places-of-power.html" title="Places of Power">Places of Power</a> Appendix so you know where all of these monoliths are. Then you should follow the Archetype guidelines and collect these additional points as early as possible, “front-loading” the Abilities you can unlock.</p>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Budget Constraints For Ability Points</h3>
<p class="Tip">It’s important not to waste Ability Points, as you only receive one per level (or for each Place of Power you visit). Therefore, when you’re choosing the initial 12 Abilities to place into each of the four “slots” in the middle of your Character Menu, you should initially focus on 12 Abilities that complement each other (and can be linked by Greater <a href="../../inventory-data/mutagens.html" title="Mutagens">Mutagens</a> for additional bonuses).</p>
<p class="Tip">Then, you can spend additional points unlocking Mutations, so you can add another four Ability slots bringing the total to 16, as well as unlock a special Mutation effect (from a choice of 12). This takes considerable time, so expect to perform this during a New Game + adventure, during your second visit to each Place of Power, and after completing the Blood and Wine Secondary Quest: Turn and Face the Strange..</p>
<p class="Tip">However, you are free to purchase more Abilities than you have slots to use. For example, you may wish to keep Axii Delusion off your slots during <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>, but place it into a slot when conversing with characters. Or you may have a set of three Aard abilities you use sometimes, and swap between them depending on the enemy. If you tailor your fighting against human-sized foes and <a href="../../inventory-data/monsters.html" title="monsters">monsters</a> differently, you may wish to swap out a few Abilities accordingly.</p>
<p class="Tip">If all else fails, use a Potion of Clearing and purchase Abilities again, all at once, without making mistakes this time!</p>
</aside>
<h3>Armor Makes The Mutant</h3>
<p>Using a particular type of <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> (and weaponry) is usually critical to help augment the abilities, <a href="../../inventory-data/glyphs.html" title="glyphs">glyphs</a> (and <a href="../../inventory-data/runestones.html" title="runestones">runestones</a>), and other enchantments you need to add to maximize the effectiveness of your archetype. For this, the best available <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> (and weapons) has been recommended. If you can’t find this equipment, or lack the Level to wear it, find some with a similar weight, or statistics before you graduate to the optimal outfit and armaments. When in doubt, use Witcher gear!</p>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>An Outfit For Every Occasion</h3>
<p class="Tip">As you progress, you should think about setting up various outfits that coordinate—not with fabrics but with similar elements or effects. For example, you should try an outfit for Fast Attacks, Strong Attacks, Sign Intensity, or a mixture of different elements, as you decide which one you prefer using in <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>, and what is most suitable to your style of play.</p>
<p class="Tip">Example: You wish to increase your Sign intensity. To get the best bonuses, you should choose Griffin School <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> (as they have an innate Intensity bonus). In addition, you should partner the <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> with the General Ability: Griffin School Techniques, which adds more bonuses to Sign Intensity.</p>
</aside>
<h3>Spending Your Crowns Wisely</h3>
<p>It is worth making money in order to unlock advantages such as <a href="../the-ofieri-runewright.html" title="the Ofieri Runewright">the Ofieri Runewright</a>, <a href="../armorers-and-blacksmiths.html" title="Armorers and Blacksmiths">Armorers and Blacksmiths</a> to craft your most impressive gear, and other accouterments the influence an archetype. It costs crowns and time to craft a set of Mastercrafted <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>, and Witcher Gear is even more time-consuming to find and build. But the results are well worth it!</p>
<h3>Upper Levels And Ng+</h3>
<p>Once you reach upper Levels (50+), or you’re starting a New Game +, you should have built your Archetype to the state where it is optimal, and started to unlock Mutations. At this point you can continue to add abilities so you become more and more focused, or change and opt for a different Archetype completely. Starting New Game + is usually a great idea, as you’re able to access all the <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/places-of-power.html" title="Places of Power">Places of Power</a> again, adding a potential 30 extra points, as well as slowly gaining experience points and Character Levels.</p>
<h3>Last On Your List: Mutations</h3>
<p>Remember that the final abilities you crave are the mysterious Mutations; accessed only after completing Blood and Wine: Secondary Quest: Turn and Face the Strange. This eventually increases your total Abilities from 12 to 16, and adds a specific, immensely powerful Mutation you can employ. Each archetype lists 16 Abilities, so you can choose which order the first 12 of them are placed, before the final four are unlocked after Mutations are complete. Fair warning; it takes 55 points (each from raising a level or finding a Place of Power) to unlock all four Ability Slots (so you can activate all 16) as well as researching any of the 12 available Mutations, so expect to start a New Game + and revisit all 30 <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/places-of-power.html" title="Places of Power">Places of Power</a> again to bolster your points.</p>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Potion Of Clearance</h3>
<p class="Tip">Remember this potion, available at select Merchants (as detailed in the Merchant Appendix) allows you to wipe away all Abilities, and redistribute all the points, in case you wish to change Archetypes at any time.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="Caution">
<h3>I Want A Second Opinion!</h3>
<p class="Caution">The following Archetypes represent opinions from multiple adventures with Witchers from various Schools, and advice from the elder Witcher Vesemir himself. Though highly recommended, such advice may not sit well with your particular style of play, and you are free to use, augment, or ignore every one of these Archetypes. They are meant to be a peek into the countless possibilities of creating the ultimate Witcher, not a set of rules to abide by.</p>
</aside>
<h3>Archetype Specifics: Building A Better Archetype</h3>
<p>The following archetypes offer you a great range of possible ways to augment Geralt as your adventure continues. All are primarily focused on the Character Menu, where your abilities are unlocked. Archetypes are divided into four main groups:</p>
<p><strong class="Body-bold"><a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a> Related: </strong>Emphasis on the (red) <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a> Branch of Ability Tree.</p>
<p><strong class="Body-bold"><a href="../combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> Related: </strong>Emphasis on the (blue) <a href="../combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> Branch of Ability Tree.</p>
<p><strong class="Body-bold"><a href="../../inventory-data/alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a> Related: </strong>Emphasis on the (green) <a href="../../inventory-data/alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a> Branch of Ability Tree.</p>
<p><strong class="Body-bold"><a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/bestiary/hybrids.html" title="Hybrids">Hybrids</a>: </strong>Elements from all four main branches of the Ability Tree, including the (yellow) General Branch of Ability Tree.</p>
<aside class="Note">
<h3>An Artist’s Impression Of Each Archetype</h3>
<p class="Note">The Archetype information begins with a picture of Geralt as the archetype in question, clad in archetype-specific <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> and carrying specific weaponry. Hairstyles, masks, or eyewear are just for show. The statistical data next to the screen includes some permanent buffs (from <a href="../../inventory-data/glyphs.html" title="Glyphs">Glyphs</a> for example), but not temporary buffs (from <a href="../../inventory-data/potions.html" title="potions">potions</a>, for example), and no bonuses from the Runewright. Each character’s statistics are based on the ultimate versions of items (Greater <a href="../../inventory-data/runestones.html" title="Runestones">Runestones</a>, Greater <a href="../../inventory-data/mutagens.html" title="Mutagens">Mutagens</a>, Grand Master <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>, and Grand Master weapons, for example), and Geralt’s Level is set at 50. Blood and Wine is also included in the statistics. This is to give you some idea of the bonuses you should be aiming for.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="Note">
<h3>(Dm!) Death March! And {Ng+) New Game +</h3>
<p class="Note">If an Archetype has “(DM!)” after its name, it is recommended for Death March! difficulty level. If an Archetype has “(NG+)” after its name, it is recommended for New Game +.</p>
</aside>
<h4>The Recommended Abilities Chart</h4>
<p>Each Archetype has a chart showing the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="Body-bold">Ability Tree: </strong>The number of recommended abilities for each of the four Branches of the Ability Tree.</li>
<li><strong class="Body-bold">Points to Unlock: </strong>How many ability points must have been spent to unlock the ability. These range from 0-30.</li>
<li><strong class="Body-bold">Levels: </strong>How many levels the recommended ability has. These range from 0-5. The chart always recommends the maximum ability, but you can purchase the ability levels in any order you like.</li>
<li><strong class="Body-bold">Branch and Ability Name: </strong>Which of the five sections of a particular branch the ability is from, and its name. These are listed as they appear left to right on your Character Menu.</li>
<li><strong class="Body-bold">Total Ability Points Needed: </strong>This number shows how many ability points are needed to reach the maximum level in all 12 of the recommended abilities (essentially, how many Levels you need to raise your character, minus any <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/places-of-power.html" title="Places of Power">Places of Power</a> you interact with). A second, asterisked number indicates the four additional abilities you may wish to unlock after the first 12, once Blood and Wine Mutations are active. If a third number appears, these indicate abilities that should be unlocked in order to reach a more important, recommended Ability.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="Note">
<h3>Unimproved Combat Offense: Still Useful!</h3>
<p class="Note">Just because an aspect of Geralt’s <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> offense hasn’t been advanced through expenditure in abilities, doesn’t mean it should ignored in ctombat. For example, Igni is helpful for setting enemies ablaze, whether you’ve spent points in this Sign’s branch or not.</p>
</aside>
<h4>The Recommended Equipment And Enhancements</h4>
<p>After the ability chart is a list of important equipment and enhancements, along with the recommended specific item to further improve the Archetype. These are elements that increase the potency of the Archetype and offer incredible “stacking” bonuses (that are added on top of other bonuses) to turn Geralt into an almost unstoppable killing machine. Every element is battle-tested and approved, from the types of <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="Bombs">Bombs</a> to lob to the Runewords your swords should be inscribed with.</p>
<aside class="Note">
<h3>Ursine Armor? But I’m Only Level 3!</h3>
<p class="Note">The recommended equipment represents the final and most potent items and enhancements to obtain. It will take considerable time to reach this demi-god like status, so if you see an item you can’t use, such as Ursine Witcher <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> you can’t wear because you aren’t a high enough level, consult the Inventory In A Witcher’s Tools section of the eGuide online, and look at the statistics for the element in question. Then compare it to a lower level substitute; such as Heavy <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> in place of Ursine <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="Note">
<h3>No Oils? Unmentioned Items? Still Useful!</h3>
<p class="Note">There are no recommended <a href="../../inventory-data/oils.html" title="oils">oils</a> for archetypes as each is specific to a type of enemy, and thus situational. You are also encouraged to utilize elements that aren’t necessarily mentioned but are still worthwhile, such as Swallow potion for your Vitality, or <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> that may not have been mentioned. The listed elements are simply the items and enhancements best suited to the build in question.</p>
</aside>
<h4>General Advice</h4>
<p>After the list is some general advice regarding why specific elements were chosen for the archetype. An explanation of what this archetype’s main reason for existing is (to have the best damage per second, for example), and how the various items and enhancements work together, are explained.</p>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>What’s The Point Of It All?</h3>
<p class="Tip">Just how many Ability Points is it possible to acquire? The answer may surprise you!</p>
<p class="Tip">Points for Leveling Up: 99 (you receive 1 point each time you reach a new level, starting at Level 2, and ending at Level 100).</p>
<p class="Tip">Points for visiting <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/places-of-power.html" title="Places of Power">Places of Power</a>: 30 (you receive 1 point for each Place of Power you examine).</p>
<p class="Tip">Points for visiting <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/places-of-power.html" title="Places of Power">Places of Power</a> in New Game +: 30 (when you begin New Game +, you can revisit all 30 <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/places-of-power.html" title="Places of Power">Places of Power</a> once again).</p>
<p class="Tip">Points for completing quests: 3 (You receive 2 skill points for eating the acorn lying under the tree during <a href="../../quest-walkthrough-act-iii/main-quest-bald-mountain/feast-of-gifts-the-wiseman-the-guard-and-the-godling.html" title="Main Quest: Bald Mountain">Main Quest: Bald Mountain</a>. You receive 1 point obtaining the golden egg, laid by the Golden Goose, during Blood and Wine: Secondary Quest: Duck, Duck, Goosed!).</p>
<p class="Tip">Points for completing quests in New Game +: 3 (you can complete both the quests again in New Game + and claim the three ability points a second time).</p>
<p class="Tip">Total Points available: 164 (assuming you complete all tasks listed previously).</p>
<p class="Tip">Points needed to unlock all <a href="../combat/overview.html" title="Combat">Combat</a> Branch Abilities: 91.</p>
<p class="Tip">Points needed to unlock all <a href="../combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> Branch Abilities: 79.</p>
<p class="Tip">Points needed to unlock all <a href="../../inventory-data/alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a> Branch Abilities: 90.</p>
<p class="Tip">Points needed to unlock all General Branch Abilities: 20.</p>
<p class="Tip">Total Points (known as Research Points) needed to unlock all 12 Blood and Wine Mutations: 55</p>
<p class="Tip">Total Points to unlock everything: 335.</p>
<p class="Tip">As you cannot ever hope to unlock every single Ability and Blood and Wine Mutations, simply focus on those abilities of particular interest to you that work in conjunction with other abilities, with specializations that benefit you the most.</p>
<p class="Tip">Finally, remember that some Ability points are easier to come by than others. For example, there are six <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/places-of-power.html" title="Places of Power">Places of Power</a> in <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/white-orchard.html" title="White Orchard">White Orchard</a> alone, so it is helpful that you locate these monoliths as early as possible, as long as you aren’t placing yourself in too much danger. Need to know where all the <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/places-of-power.html" title="Places of Power">Places of Power</a> are? Consult the appendix.</p>
