<p>A multitude of merchants and innkeepers, as well as some more infamous players and friends of yours, have been known to partake in this pastime. You may also stumble across professionals in a regional competition or encounter an ongoing tournament at a larger social event. There are also a few <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> players that you have only one opportunity to challenge while tackling another quest. Almost all of these players reward you with a new <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> card the first time you beat them.</p>
<h3>Who Really Plays Gwent, Though? </h3>
<h4>A Card-Collecting: An Overview</h4>
<p>Obtaining cards for your increasingly-large <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> collection (the complete card collection numbers 255 cards) involves winning a multitude of games (also known as rounds or bouts), the successful completion of certain quests, or purchasing cards from particular vendors, and other general tomfoolery. These can be segmented into the following categories:</p>
<h5>Collection Plan #1A: In Your Base Deck (32 Cards)</h5>
<figure class="full">
<a href="../../media/files/092-139_gwent_game_of_cards-web-resources/image/A02-GWENTINTRO_003.jpg">

</a>
</figure>
<p>Congratulations! You already have 32 Cards (mainly from the <a href="./northern-realms-deck/northern-realms-leader-cards-5.html" title="Northern Realms Deck">Northern Realms Deck</a>), meaning you can start playing <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> immediately (find your cards in the “<a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> Deck” part of the <a href="../training/main-menu.html" title="Main Menu">Main Menu</a> (the left column menu, not your inventory menu). Obviously, there’s (much more) room for improvement in terms of creating better decks, but this leaves only 223 left to find!</p>
<h5><a href="../../media/BaW_icon.png"><img src="../../media/BaW_icon.png"/></a> Collection Plan #1B: In Your Blood and Wine Base Deck (24 Cards)</h5>
<p>Great news! When you embark on your adventures into the realm of <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/toussaint.html" title="Toussaint">Toussaint</a>, by Starting the <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> Quest: To Everything Turn, Turn, Tournament!, you receive an additional 24 Cards, all related to the fifth Faction: The <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/skellige.html" title="Skellige">Skellige</a> Clans deck. As you’d expect, there are additional cards to bolster this faction (another 19, in fact) as you explore this new territory.</p>
<h5><a href="../../media/BaW_icon.png"><img src="../../media/BaW_icon.png"/></a> Collection plan #2: purchased from traders (87 Cards) </h5>
<p>Over one hundred of the <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> cards you’re after are found at the shops of various traders across the Northern Realms. These are always one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Body-BL">Merchants (most, but not all)</li>
<li class="Body-BL">Innkeeps (most, but not all)</li>
<li class="Body-BL">Named characters you know (such as Marquise Serenity of the Passiflora brothel in <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/novigrad.html" title="Novigrad">Novigrad</a> City).</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply hand over your hard-earned crowns in return for the card you want. Each vendor has a specific collection of (usually four or five) cards to buy, so always buy from them if you have the funds. Each card costs between 10 and 70 crowns, and for all of them, expect to pay no more than 26,000 crowns! This may sound like a lot, but have you seen how much that Ofieri Runewright needs to start his business?</p>
<p>If you don’t want to meticulously gather only a few cards from traders in the Northern Realms, there’s good news. The Duchy of <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/toussaint.html" title="Toussaint">Toussaint</a>’s Innkeeps sell a large number of random cards from a specific list. This is a very quick way to bolster your decks without the more involved hunting for cards, though you can’t find the most potent cards by simply purchasing them from <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/toussaint.html" title="Toussaint">Toussaint</a> Innkeeps.</p>

For a complete list of traders you can buy from, consult the Merchant Appendix.</p>
</aside>
<h5>Collection Plan #3: Won From A (Non-Quest) Gwent Player (53 Cards)</h5>
<p>Over 50 of your cards are won by challenging a no-name <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> fan scattered through towns and countryside. Most offer a random card if you better them, though some give you specific cards. There are a variety of <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> types that would love to play you:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Body-BL">Armorers, Blacksmiths, Brothel Madames*, Herbalists, Innkeeps*, a Loneshark, Merchants*, Quartermasters*, Scholars, and Traders.*</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em class="body-italic">*Some—but not all—of this type of <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> Player may also have cards to sell, too.</em>

<h4>Players With Specific Cards To Win (6 Players and Cards)</h4>
<p>There are 6 <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> players (Aldert Geert the <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> tutor in the <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/white-orchard.html" title="White Orchard">White Orchard</a> Tavern, the Nilfgaardian Nobleman inside the <a href="../atlas/royal-palace-vizima.html" target="_blank" title="Royal Palace in Vizima">Royal Palace in Vizima</a>, The Elven Merchant of the Traveling Circus Camp outside Carsten, Shani, Olgierd von Everec, and Hilbert at the Borsodi Auction House during Hearts of Stone Main Quest: Open Sesame who don’t have an associated quest, but hand over a specific <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> card if you beat them. Over in <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/toussaint.html" title="Toussaint">Toussaint</a>, there are 19 <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> players (almost all merchants of some kind) that have a specific <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/skellige.html" title="Skellige">Skellige</a> Clans card you must win from them. .</p>
<h4>Players With Random Cards To Win (83 Players, 67 Cards)</h4>
<p>There are 83 <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> players (across <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/white-orchard.html" title="White Orchard">White Orchard</a>, <a href="../videos/treasure-hunts/velen.html" title="Velen">Velen</a>, <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/novigrad.html" title="Novigrad">Novigrad</a>, and <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/skellige.html" title="Skellige">Skellige</a>) that hand over a random <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> card if you beat them. The rest of the <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> cards are won by challenging them. The first time you beat a <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> player, you receive the (random) card. Each subsequent time, you simply win any money you bet before the bout. This means you must visit a minimum of 52 of the 65 <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> players to obtain all the randomly-given cards.</p>

If you’re talking to someone who is up for a <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> game, the second (orange) icon appears as a conversation choice. At this point, it would be really great to have a complete list of who and where these people are; which is why that has been provided (see the Gwentfolk of the Northern Realms.</p>

<h5>Collection Plan #4: Found Or Won During A Gwent Quest (23 Cards)</h5>
<p>There are 23 cards you need to win from a specific individuals as part of one of the five available <a href="../gwent-quests/overview-a-game-within-a-game.html" title="Gwent Quests">Gwent Quests</a> (Playing Innkeeps, <a href="../videos/treasure-hunts/velen.html" title="Velen">Velen</a> Players, Big City Players, Old Pals, and <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/skellige.html" title="Skellige">Skellige</a> Style). Opponents always give you a specific card, and you must face each one in a particular order (subsequent players in a quest won’t play until you’ve beaten previous ones first). The last (and most difficult) opponent in each <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> Quest gives you two specific cards (one from their deck, and one for completing the quest. Consult these quests first, and follow the objectives mentioned within each quest.</p>

<h3>OFF THE CARDS: KNOW WHEN TO HOLD ‘EM!</h3>
<p class="Caution">It is vitally important that you check the <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a>: Complete Card Checklist section before embarking on <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> and <a href="../secondary-quests/overview.html" title="Secondary Quests">Secondary Quests</a> if you want every single card. Certain players, such as those you find at the Vegelbud Residence during <a href="../quest-walkthrough-act-i-novigrad/secondary-quest-a-matter-of-life-and-death/whats-the-best-price-on-a-trout.html" title="Secondary Quest: A Matter of Life and Death">Secondary Quest: A Matter of Life and Death</a>, won’t be seen again. The same goes for characters that might die during your adventure. If they’re dead, they can’t be challenged to a game of <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> now, can they? However, in certain circumstances, they may leave their card behind. If this occurs, it is mentioned in the appendices, but don’t count on this as a way to gather all cards!</p>
</aside>
<aside class="Note">
<h3>CARD TOTALS</h3>
<p class="Note">The numbered totals aren’t necessary to worry about, as some cards can be gathered from multiple sources. Instead, concentrate on finding the cards you need, as quickly as possible. A visit to <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/toussaint.html" title="Toussaint">Toussaint</a> helps, as certain Innkeeps sell a good (random) variety of cards to quickly bolster your decks.</p>
</aside>
<h5>Collection Plan #5: Found Or Won During A Secondary Quest (15 Cards)</h5>
<p>There are 15 cards that are only acquired during a Secondary Quest (excluding <a href="../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/toussaint.html" title="Toussaint">Toussaint</a>). Some are won during tournaments with the very best players around, and some are found during a quest. Take great care not to miss these cards, as they can’t be gathered after the quest concludes!</p>

<h5>Collection Plan #6: Loose Cards: Found On The Ground (1 Card)</h5>
<p>Someone left a card lying around in a barn in Brunwich. It’s the fabled Cow card, with hidden depths to its statistics. Don’t forget that prized heifer! Also, some cards you can’t win from an opponent (due to them dying, for example). These are placed loose for you to pick up, though this isn’t the optimal way to find these cards.</p>

<h3>OFF THE CARDS: KNOW WHEN TO FOLD ‘EM!</h3>
<p class="Caution">Pay special attention to cards that appear on the lists only once; there’s only one available! Check the <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a>: <a href="./complete-card-checklist-chart.html" title="Complete Card Checklist Chart">Complete Card Checklist Chart</a> before you start any related quests, so you don’t finish a quest or kill off a character and finish the quest without a card. Are you coming up to a tournament bout of <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a>? Then save your game before each bout in case you fail. As there are multiple times you might accidentally lose a card forever, some scholars have deemed <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> Quest: Collect ‘em All to be the most difficult quest of Geralt’s life!</p>

<h3>Gwent Difficulty Level: a Real Challenge</h3>
<p class="Tip">Are you finding your <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> bouts too easy? Need more of a challenge? Or are you about to start a quest involving a Gwewnt tournament, and want to increase your odds of victory? Then fiddle with the <a href="./gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> difficulty level! There are three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, and Hard. Increase your difficulty if you require a more competitive opponent who is more likely to play stronger cards against you. This has no impact on the cards you receive from winning, however.</p>
