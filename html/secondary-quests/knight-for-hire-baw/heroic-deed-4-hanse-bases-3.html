<p>The toughest job, if you’re helping the Knight Errants, is the clearing of three huge bandit bases. These take considerable time, preparation, and skill to emerge victorious from, and the odds are the most overwhelming you’ve ever faced!</p>
<p>Each of the three Hanses is a base of operations for an infamous outlaw gang commanded by a particularly unhinged leader. These bandits are well-organized and when attacked, they call for help from neighboring camps. To prevent this, kill bandits running with torches (that show up on your mini-map) toward signal fires (also on your mini-map). Your goal is to kill the hanse’s leader. Once this occurs, the Knights Errant take over this location, and you can claim a reward.</p>
<table class="web-custom-items" id="table637"><colgroup> <col> </colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="web-custom-items">
<td class="web-custom-items">
<p><strong class="Body-bold">Items:</strong> Crowns (100 per Hanse)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In each location, you should expect upward of 20 bandits, and around 10 Hanse Dogs to face. Some bandits have long swinging hammers, while others carry shields. Tucked away in a separate area of the camp is the Hanse leader himself; a particularly hardy specimen. Your job is to remove all enemies from the Hanse.</p>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>HANDLING A HANSE BASE: GENERAL TACTICS</h3>
<p class="Tip">Each Hanse base has some particularly troubling topography to navigate, and specific advice is given below. However, there are some general pieces of pertinent advice to follow before every Hanse massacre:</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Only Witchers of Level 48 and over are recommended to try these Hanse assaults.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Look at the guide’s <a href="../../atlas/using-the-atlas.html" title="Atlas">Atlas</a> maps for the general area surrounding the Hanse, and methodically remove any bandit camps that are nearby. If you need to retreat, you don’t want to run into further trouble. Ensure the Hanse is the only bandit-related area left in the vicinity.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Consult the <a href="../../atlas/using-the-atlas.html" title="Atlas">Atlas</a> for each Hanse to pinpoint the exact location of the Hanse’s signal fire; keeping your foes to a minimum is the recommended strategy here.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">When launching a raid into a Hanse, your overwhelmingly important plan is to stop the torch-carrier before he reaches the signal fire. It’s even worth shrugging off some damage while pushing through to reach the bandit with the torch.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Study the layout of the Hanse and read up on the exact route the torch-carrier takes, so you can stop him before he lights the signal fire, and 20 or so more foes come to slice you into morsels for their hounds.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL"><a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="Bombs">Bombs</a> that freeze foes are particularly useful (like Northern Wind), and can help you reach a fleeing torch-carrier (by incapacitating those between you and the target).</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Deal with the torch-bearer himself by casting Axii, confusing him so he stops in a daze, and then cut him down; this is the easiest way to deal with the torch-carrier by far!</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Other methods of stopping the torch bearers include using explosive-tipped crossbow <a href="../../inventory-data/bolts.html" title="bolts">bolts</a>, northern wind followed up by crossbow shots, or other ranged attacks. Sprinting up behind and slashing with your sword works, but is far less effective as you need to be very close to the torch-carrier, and he usually has a head-start on you.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">There is only one torch-carrier and one signal fire. Once you nullify the carrier, the only way reinforcements arrive is if you “accidentally” set fire to the signal fire with Igni. Some Witchers prefer a challenge, and leave the torch-carrier or light the fire themselves!</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Once the torch-carrier is slain, take your time and slay foes without becoming surrounded, stopping to check your mini-map for stragglers before progressing further into a Hanse.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">After dealing with the torch-carrier, gradually retreat. It’s worth fighting in surroundings you’re familiar with than dashing further into these strongholds and alarming yet more foes! Find areas such as stairs or courtyards, or corridors where a minimal number of foes can be faced at once.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Remember you cannot jump high or climb ladders during <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>, so don’t rush into dead-end areas with no way out of them except through an overwhelming bandit force.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">As you haven’t seen as many foes attack at one time before, area-of-effect attacks (such as your Witcher Mutations, and improved Aard, Axii, Igni, and Yrden), as well as <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a>, are all excellent choices to soften up multiple foes at once. The carnage can be immense!</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">After all of the footsoldiers are culled, the Hanse isn’t cleared until the leader is faced. Expect a tougher bandit, but one that succumbs to your usual <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> tactics. If you’re having trouble, just use Axii and cut him down.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Check the Hanse afterward; there are always high-value <a href="../../inventory-data/diagrams/crafting-component-diagrams.html" title="diagrams">diagrams</a>, <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>, and other trinkets that make this prolonged bloodshed worthwhile!</p>

<h3>HANSE BASE #1: ARTHACH PALACE RUINS</h3>
<p>Located at the very northern part of the Vedette Valley Territory, this old elven ruin slowly sinking into the marsh features a central island, shallow waters you can fight in, and a few scattered bandit camps.</p>
<figure class="full"><a href="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ710-011.jpg"> <img src="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ710-011.jpg"/> </a></figure>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>HANDLING A HANSE BASE: ARTHACH PALACE RUINS</h3>
<p class="Tip-BL">This base can be struck from all sides, which is helpful and allows much more flexibility to your ranged attacks. If you’re overwhelmed, you can retreat out of the mayhem to rest before returning.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">The signal fire here is on the north side of the base, on an open but raised ruined bridge walkway. The torch-carrier starts outside the central structure, before running into the west arch, and north across to light the fire.<a href="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ710-012.jpg"><img src="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ710-012.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Attacking from the west allows you to easily intercept the torch-carrier, daze him with Axii, and cut him down.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Defending the bridge walkway with the signal fire at the end of it (where the chest with the Witcher <a href="../../inventory-data/diagrams/crafting-component-diagrams.html" title="diagrams">diagrams</a> is) can be dangerous if you’re swarmed with foes, as you can’t leap off with your sword drawn, though you have opportunities to cause mass casualties as the foes cluster on the bridge.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Darting in and out of the center of the arched ruins is a good way to quickly reach foes (rather than navigating around the swamp exterior), and the arches make good cover from archers.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">The swamp (particularly the large trees) can also help you thin out groups of bandits to tackle at once. The biggest help (a wide open space) can also be a hindrance as it’s easy to get swarmed.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Try leading groups of foes to the raised walkway bridge to the south; it has no low walls to get stuck near, and the bridge can easily be fallen from. This allows you to use the low stone walls to protect you from archers, and cluster foes so you can use area-of-effect projectiles or <a href="../../training/combat/signs.html" title="signs">signs</a>.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Antoine “Starling” Straggen is the leader of this Hanse. When <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> is abated, climb the ladder on the south stone walkway, move along the rickety wood balcony, and face him on the upper central area of the ruins. He uses a heavy two-handed hammer. But if you use Axii, he’s less of a threat. Check his area for some notes of his machinations</p>
Once the Hanse is cleared, Knight Errant forces appear to take over this position. Expect a deep discount from a Journeyman Blacksmith that is now at this location.</aside>

<h3>HANSE BASE #2: MONT CRANE CASTLE</h3>
<p>Resilient against the winds of Mont Crane is the sprawling castle atop this mountain, in the northeastern part of The Champs-Désolés. Expect the majority of <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> to occur within the crumbling walls of this fortification.</p>
<figure class="full"><a href="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ710-014.jpg"> <img src="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ710-014.jpg"/> </a></figure>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>HANDLING A HANSE BASE: MONT CRANE CASTLE</h3>
<p class="Tip-BL">The two roads to the west and south of the castle are each patrolled by bandits on horseback; tackle these enemies (one pair, one group of three) before assaulting the castle itself.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Charge into the lower courtyard, and a torch-bearer tries to flee up the steps. Concentrate on him first if you aren’t wanting to face reinforcements. Expect around six foes in this lower area.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">You can use the gap in the exterior battlements left of the main gate, below the ballista, and with some careful jumping you can leap up, past the ballista, and more easily catch the torch-carrier.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Try to keep the torch-carrier in the lower courtyard (by blowing him up, using ranged weapons, or sprinting and hacking at him).</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">If you ignore the torch-bearer, the fire is usually lit when you reach the upper bailey and fight for a minute or so; a large walled area of grass with tents at the top of some long stone steps. Around 12 reinforcement foes charge in up the steps behind you, and may overwhelm you.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Charging the signal fire isn’t feasible, as it’s too far away and high up to reach before the fire is lit, so cut down the foe running as early as possible.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">You may wish to actively encourage more foes to arrive, to gain additional experience and enjoy much more carnage! If you do, retreat to the northwest ruined castle chambers, where you have cover and foes (plus their hounds) can only approach one at a time.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Stealthy Witchers may wish to enter the lower courtyard, turn right, and climb up through a ruined tower to reach an upper covered deck where you have more cover, and access to the top of the main open stairs to the upper bailey, though this isn’t the best way to catch the torch-bearer.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Well-timed <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> thrown at the reinforcements streaming up the steps can cause mass casualties, especially if you quickly switch from a Northern Wind bomb to an explosive or Igni blast. Drop area-of-effect magic or <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> at the top of the steps, when the foes show up en masse.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Fighting in the open usually makes you susceptible to archers, though by now your activity point allocation should make ranged attacks moot. If you need to hide from the archers on the upper bailey, dip below the wall on the stone stairs at the upper bailey entrance, while coaxing foes into an easily-dispatched group.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Fighting on the signal tower spiral steps is unwise, especially at the top, as you can easily fall after being struck by a foe. Incapacitate enemies with Northern Wind, <a href="../../training/combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a>, or crossbow <a href="../../inventory-data/bolts.html" title="bolts">bolts</a> to lessen the chances of losing your footing.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Need to flee? Leap from the upper bailey, down to the lower courtyard, and back up to the stream, using the high castle walls as cover.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Remain in the northwest castle ramparts after the main fighting has died down, find a ladder, and climb onto the wooden platforms, facing a couple more armored foes as you reach a second ladder, and more platforms leading all the way to the top.</p>
<figure class="full"><a href="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ710-016.jpg"><img src="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ710-016.jpg"/></a></figure>
<p></p>
<p class="Tip-BL">This is where Filibert Fourfingers – the Hanse leader – resides. He is clad in heavy <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a>, and tough to hack apart easily, though you can parry and push him back toward the red explosive barrel, then light it with Igni or a flaming crossbow bolt (or explosive bomb). Or just Axii his brain. Then check his perch for some notes. You’ll find some orders from Filibert at the nearby Knight Errant in Distress.</p>
Once the Hanse is cleared, Knight Errant forces appear to take over this position. Expect a deep discount from a Journeyman Armorer that appears at this location.</aside>

<p>In the far northern climes of the Gorgon Foothills, north of Fox Hollow (which is an Abandoned Site full of bandits, and a recommended culling spot before the Caves are assaulted), is a deep gorge in the wooded hills. You can fall to your death from above. A better plan is to assault from the river, into the mouth of a small cave.</p>
<figure class="full"><a href="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ710-017.jpg"> <img src="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ710-017.jpg"/> </a></figure>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>HANDLING A HANSE BASE: TULASENS CAVES</h3>
<p class="Tip-BL">Though the map marker of this Hanse shows it just south of a deep fissure leading to a shallow underground stream, the only real way to actually engage the foes in this base is to search the river to the southwest, and uncover a small bandit camp at the cave mouth. Tackle the four foes here before heading into the cave. Note there’s a second cave entrance to the east of here, but it has an iron gate that is locked and cannot be accessed now.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Watch the left side of the stone passage; you don’t want to fall into the rock-walled streams of this Hanse at any time, as it’s difficult to get out, and you’ll attract unwanted attention.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Reach the first wooden footbridge, before sprinting across and through the first set of foes, focusing on the torch-carrier. He runs up the long right-curving path, then up</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">the wooden steps to the signal fire at the top of the open cave fissure. Use Axii before he reaches the steps to ensure this doesn’t happen.</p>
<figure class="full"><a href="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ710-018.jpg"><img src="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ710-018.jpg"/></a></figure>
<p></p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Now turn your attention to the assembled bandits. As the cave complex is dark and confusing, a good idea is to face foes where you killed the torch-carrier, retreating back to the first wooden bridge and using that narrow opening to funnel foes into your attacks (so you aren’t overwhelmed). Retreat to the cave mouth if you wish; then slay bandits in a much more manageable manner.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">The steps up to the signal fire are difficult to navigate, and you can easily be swamped by foes. As the only way to escape is a death plummet, stay away from here (even if the signal fire is about to be lit).</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">There are side passages, the watery stream below, and other small bridges and ledges to explore. Do this after <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>, and not before, to minimize risk of becoming lost or trapped.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Head roughly south, passing a waterfall gorge to your left as you cross a wooden bridge, push open an iron gate, and enter the lair of Loth Halfbreed, the Hanse leader in these parts. He favors a sword and shield. You should favor an Axii flummoxing and quick murdering.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Once the Hanse is cleared, Knight Errant forces appear to take over this position, with a Journeyman Armorer (found in the north part of the cave). Search Loth’s corpse for his notes and a key to unlock the southeastern cave exit, off this area, allowing a quick access out to the river.</p>

<li class="Tip-BL">Though the map marker of this Hanse shows it just south of a deep fissure leading to a shallow underground stream, the only real way to actually engage the foes in this base is to search the river to the southwest, and uncover a small bandit camp at the cave mouth. Tackle the four foes here before heading into the cave. Note there’s a second cave entrance to the east of here, but it has an iron gate that is locked and cannot be accessed now.</li>
<li class="Tip-BL">Watch the left side of the stone passage; you don’t want to fall into the rock-walled streams of this Hanse at any time, as it’s difficult to get out, and you’ll attract unwanted attention.</li>
<li class="Tip-BL">Reach the first wooden footbridge, before sprinting across and through the first set of foes, focusing on the torch-carrier. He runs up the long right-curving path, then up the wooden steps to the signal fire at the top of the open cave fissure. Use Axii before he reaches the steps to ensure this doesn’t happen.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li class="Tip-BL">Now turn your attention to the assembled bandits. As the cave complex is dark and confusing, a good idea is to face foes where you killed the torch-carrier, retreating back to the first wooden bridge and using that narrow opening to funnel foes into your attacks (so you aren’t overwhelmed). Retreat to the cave mouth if you wish; then slay bandits in a much more manageable manner.</li>
<li class="Tip-BL">The steps up to the signal fire are difficult to navigate, and you can easily be swamped by foes. As the only way to escape is a death plummet, stay away from here (even if the signal fire is about to be lit).</li>
