<p><a href="../../../media/bullet_arr_red.png"><img src="../../../media/bullet_arr_red.png"/></a> If you told Guillaume “a powerful curse afflicts her” and told him about the exact nature of Vivienne’s curse on the night before the final Tourney Trial, you meet her gazing across the lake at her tent. She asks if you might explain the exact nature of the egg ritual to her, but you think an alternate method might be best, despite her protests. A heroic Guillaume appears from his hiding place, hands proudly on his hips, telling Vivienne he will save her. Vivienne is furious at this interruption of a private conversation. Answer her as you wish.</p>
<p>Guillaume explains to Vivienne that she no longer bears this burden alone. Vivienne flashes an angry look your way at betraying her trust, while Guillaume explains he understands how she feels, for he had an aunt who contracted a strange illness. He wants her curse to rest on him, to take it away from her. When she asks him why, he simply states “Because I love you.” Guillaume realizes he’s been a fool facing a Shaelmaar in the arena; risking his life for no purpose. Now he can do something truly important for her. Vivienne’s demeanor softens, and you’re asked if this is a good idea. Answer as you wish. Vivienne is coming around; she was prepared to die. Now she is also prepared to attempt something mad. When you’re ready to perform the reflection ritual, let Vivienne know, and the three of you ride off into the Gorgon Foothills.</p>

<p>You finally arrive at the Hidden Clearing, dismount, and follow both Vivienne and Guillaume to the glade. A panther is prowling the area, and must be dispatched. You kneel by the water’s edge. Guillaume waits for Vivienne to reveal her true self. Guillaume thinks her beautiful, even as she stands before him in her feathered and cursed form. </p>
<p>He holds out his hand. She takes his hand, and Vivienne quietly tells Guillaume she will not leave him, even if he becomes cursed. You give the couple instructions, and they plunge into the waters.</p>
<p>Crawling from the pool, you can mention to Guillaume that you didn’t think the ritual would work, before asking how he feels. Only a slight itch! Vivienne dresses and returns; the curse is lifted, and the ritual complete as the pair were truly in love. Answer them as you wish one last time, before they depart; balls must be attended, and distant lands to be seen! After a couple of classic bird-related puns and a reward for your troubles, the two lovebirds flutter off into the woods, and the quest concludes.</p>

<h3>EPILOGUE</h3>
<p>When the Night of Long Fangs starts and Geralt witnesses the start of the attack on the city, he can find Guillaume and Vivienne with Anna Henrietta and the other nobles.</p>
<p>After finishing the Night of Long Fangs, you can encounter Guillaume and Vivienne on an observation deck on the northern side of the palace. You can have a short chat with them, during which you can learn that the curse does not seem to have great effects on Guillaume. He just started to sprout some “pubic feathers.” Vivienne likes it. After that, you can encounter both of them strolling around the marketplace of Beauclair now and then. </p>
<p>When you get the medal from Anna Henrietta for defeating the Beast of Beauclair, you can also spot Guillaume and Vivienne in the audience.</p>

<p><a href="../../../media/bullet_arr_red.png"><img src="../../../media/bullet_arr_red.png"/></a> If you told Guillaume “sorry, promised her I wouldn’t tell” and kept him in the dark about the exact nature of Vivienne’s curse on the night before the final Tourney Trial, you meet her gazing across the lake at her tent. She has decided not to endanger anyone, and chooses the method to rid herself of the curse involving the oriole’s egg. She knows there is one in the clearing you met her at. Before you explain the precise nature of the curse removal, you inform Vivienne her tent has ears. A sheepish Guillaume appears from his hiding spot. Vivienne is furious, thinking you’ve hatched a scheme unbeknownst to her. Answer her as you wish.</p>
<p>Guillaume kneels before Vivienne, telling her he lives to serve her. She sharply asks if he’s hers to command before ordering him to leave the tent, and disappear into the Duchy’s northern-most marshes. He must leave now. She wags an accusing finger at you. Comment about him figuring out everything by himself (which is true) if you wish, before inquiring whether she did the right thing. She tells you, in no uncertain terms, that she has no need for lusty knights, even though only one of the rituals is now possible. When you’re ready to continue to find the oriole egg, let Vivienne know, and the two of you ride off into the Gorgon Foothills.</p>
<p>You finally arrive at the Hidden Clearing, dismount, and follow Vivienne to the glade. A panther is prowling the area, and must be dispatched. You inspect the oriole nest Vivienne mentioned, and find the eggs have fallen on a moss patch. One is cracked. You take an egg, holding it to Vivienne’s true form. Optionally ask if she wishes to continue, before telling her to focus and repeat an incantation. As she complies, the egg you’re holding at her forehead begins to glow and pulse, before finally exploding, sending you both flying in opposite directions.</p>

</a>
</figure>
<p>When you come to, Vivienne has dressed and is excited to feel different; the curse has been lifted! She is excited to attend balls, travel to Oxenfurt, and even <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/novigrad.html" title="Novigrad">Novigrad</a>! She is most grateful, and you mention Guillaume is the one to thank. She pauses for a moment, and asks you to tell him so if you see him. Optionally ask whether she should tell him herself, before agreeing, and bidding Vivienne a farewell. She wanders into the woods.</p>
<p>You now get the task to let Guillaume know what happened. You find him at the open air tavern at the tournament grounds, but he won’t be happy when he hears what you have to say. You will still get your reward, but Guillaume walks away, not wanting to talk to you anymore.</p>
<h3>EPILOGUE</h3>
<p>After the Night of Long Fangs concludes, you can find Guillaume close to the Pheasantry. He seems to be completely drunk and falls over once we talk to him.</p>
<p>You can then also find Vivienne in the harbor of <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/novigrad.html" title="Novigrad">Novigrad</a>, where she will tell you about the places she already visited. She seems very happy and gives you the last feather that she had. You can wear it behind you ear. Vivienne gives you a hint that she might want to see <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/skellige.html" title="Skellige">Skellige</a> next.</p>
<p>After six days, we can find Vivienne living in the tavern of Kaer Trolde Village (once Yennefer moved out in the main story). After seven years, she dies.</p>
<h3>ALTERNATIVE EPILOGUE</h3>
<p>If you don’t finish the quest by the time The Night of Long Fangs starts, you can find Guillaume’s corpse in the city. He perished fighting <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/bestiary/vampires.html" title="vampires">vampires</a>. After the night is over, we might find Vivienne mourning at his grave.</p>
