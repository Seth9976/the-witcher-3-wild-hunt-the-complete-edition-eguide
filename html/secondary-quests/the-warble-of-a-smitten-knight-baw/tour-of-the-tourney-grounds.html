<h3>HOW TO START THIS QUEST</h3>
<p class="Note">This quest becomes accessible once Main Quest: The Beast of <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/toussaint.html" title="Toussaint">Toussaint</a> concludes, you then finish Main Quest: <a href="../../episode-2-main-quests-blood-and-wine/blood-run/the-beast-is-unleashed.html" title="Blood Run">Blood Run</a>, and Main Quest: <a href="../../episode-2-main-quests-blood-and-wine/la-cage-au-fou/couldve-left-the-door-unlatched.html" title="La Cage Au Fou">La Cage Au Fou</a> is active. Return to the Tourney Grounds north of Beauclair and locate Guillaume in the lazaret to begin.</p>
<p class="Note">As Guillaume may become “indisposed” later into your questing adventure (once Main Quest: The Night of Long Fangs begins), you are encouraged to complete this quest before this point.</p>
</aside>
<figure class="float"><a href="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ701-002.jpg"> <img src="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ701-002.jpg"/> </a> <figcaption> <figcaption>Guillaume de Launfal</figcaption> </figcaption></figure>
<p>Seek out the well-meaning knight named Guillaume de Launfal at the medics tent on the eastern edge of the Tourney Grounds, near the arena walls and hill down to Corvo Bianco. Guillaume, if you remember, was challenging the giant named Goylat when you first arrived in <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/places-of-power/toussaint.html" title="Toussaint">Toussaint</a>, and he was wounded during the Shaelmaar battle in the arena. Now he has a matter of prime urgency and import! Due to his arm, he’s unable to take part in the chivalrous tournament currently occurring, and wonders if you’d stand in for him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he believes something foul has occurred to a certain maiden—nay, a lady—that he’s had his eye on; a spell or curse has befallen Vivienne, one of Duchess Henrietta’s ladies in waiting who is overseeing the tournament. Optionally jest you can guess her symptoms, before asking why she seems cursed. Guillaume explains Vivienne shuns the company of others, shrieked strangely when they were walking, and ventures into the woods where she seemed to melt into thin air. You have two optional conversation choices (noticing anything else unusual and mentioning the odd behavior might not be as strange as Guillaume remembers) before asking for more information about Vivienne. He tells you about her mother (also a lady-in-waiting) and her father (a knight). Little more is known.</p>
<p>Now for the tourney plan; optionally ask Guillaume more about it, before agreeing to help (and upping your fee if you wish). Now Guillaume wishes to see how well you shoot, ride, and fight; as the three tournament events showcase one or more of these talents. Tournament rules should be learned, and put into practice. At this point, you can choose what to practice (in any order you like, though the events are in the following order):</p>
<ul>
<li class="Body-BL">“Target practice”: This begins Practice Makes Perfect Part #1 (below).</li>
<li class="Body-BL">“Horsemanship”: This begins Practice Makes Perfect Part #2 (below).</li>
<li class="Body-BL">“Let’s try sword fighting”: This starts Practice Makes Perfect Part #3 (below).</li>
<li class="Body-BL">“Don’t need any practice”: This skips the practicing sessions, which isn’t recommended, and starts the competition.</li>
</ul>

<li class="Rename-2">Shoot all six targets (6).</li>
</ul>

</table>
<p>It is a short walk to the shooting range, where Guillaume explains the simple premise; you must simply shoot the six red knights before the time ticks down to zero, and ignore any of the white and blue knight targets. Whether you complete the task or not, Guillaume asks afterward if you wish to practice again. You can practice as many times as you wish. Then you can opt to practice for the other two events, or temporarily halt the quest.</p>

<aside class="Tip">
<h3>STAYING ON TARGET</h3>
<p class="Tip">Shooting six red knights within the allotted time (around 30 seconds) is straightforward, and uses your crossbow.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Employ your regular <a href="../../inventory-data/bolts.html" title="bolts">bolts</a> (so you don’t waste any special <a href="../../inventory-data/bolts.html" title="bolts">bolts</a>), and use manual aiming.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Work from left to right, or right to left, so you are making small aiming adjustments when moving from one target to the next.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Tag each target in order (passing over targets to return to them later slows you down).</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">A most proficient Witcher should be able to knock all six targets down with around three-quarters (around 22 seconds) left in the “Time Remaining” bar.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">You can increase this still further by bringing a better crossbow with you, and/or purchasing crossbow-related Abilities; read up on these in the <a href="../../training/overview.html" title="Training">Training</a> section, starting on page 56.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">It’s worth perfecting this so you can easily win the Tournament Event itself.</p>

<p>The second of the events is over by the racing track arena, and tests your <a href="../../inventory-data/horse.html" title="horse">horse</a> riding skills, and ability to shoot and use your sword while on horseback. It is a lot more difficult than simply tagging wooden knights with a crossbow bolt! You must understand the three aspects of this event:</p>
<figure class="full"><a href="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/155276.jpg"> <img src="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/155276.jpg"/> </a> <figcaption> <figcaption>Tourney Race: Practice Course</figcaption> </figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li class="Body-BL">You must ride as if attempting a <a href="../../inventory-data/horse.html" title="horse">horse</a> race; although no others are racing with you at the same moment (either in practice or at the event); they attempt the same course, and each knight earns a point if they beat the clock.</li>
<li class="Body-BL">There are a number of dummies on the route; these can (but don’t have to be) cut with your blade.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="full"><a href="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ701-005.jpg"><img src="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ701-005.jpg"/></a></figure>
<ul>
<li class="Body-BL">There are a number of targets along the route; these can (but don’t have to be) shot using your crossbow.</li>
<li class="Body-BL">The reason to strike each dummy and target with your blade and bolt is that a successful hit increases the time you have left to complete the course, essentially giving you a better time.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="full"><a href="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ701-006.jpg"><img src="../../../media/files/358-480_secondary-quests-web-resources/image/BAW%20SQ701-006.jpg"/></a></figure>

<aside class="Tip">
<h3>STAYING THE COURSE</h3>
<p class="Tip">This practice course has a dummy, a checkpoint, a dummy, a checkpoint, a target, a checkpoint, a target, and the finish line. You have 60 seconds to complete this course. For each dummy you strike, eight seconds are added. For each target you hit, eight seconds are added.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL"><strong class="Tip-Bold">Track:</strong> Just like Races, you must gallop through each checkpoint, though you don’t need to be on the track between each checkpoint; so study the map to see any possible shortcuts you can take. Be careful, though. You lose the race if you move too far from the track.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL"><strong class="Tip-Bold">Track:</strong> Some checkpoints are around tight bends and easily missed. Fail to pass through one, and you must turn Roach around, and try again, which effectively takes you out of the running for winning this in the event itself. Treat checkpoints as more important than any other activity in this event.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL"><strong class="Tip-Bold">Track:</strong> Every time you approach a dummy or target, time slows down so you can more accurately strike them. Why not raise your sword when approaching an obstacle (like a checkpoint or bridge) so you can more accurately steer over or through it?</p>
<p class="Tip-BL"><strong class="Tip-Bold">Track:</strong> Obviously, a quicker <a href="../../inventory-data/horse.html" title="horse">horse</a> means a quicker race! You should gallop as often as possible, easing off only when sharp corners, or obstacles you are in danger of missing, appear.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL"><strong class="Tip-Bold">Track:</strong> Augment Roach with quality saddles and blinders to help him maintain a higher top speed and stamina.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL"><strong class="Tip-Bold">Dummies:</strong> Hold down your sword-swinging button and release it around five feet before you reach the dummy, so you knock its head off at the correct time. This is relatively easy providing you look ahead and manually spot each dummy. Feel free to hold down the sword button earlier than normal.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL"><strong class="Tip-Bold">Targets:</strong> These are much more difficult to strike, as Roach continues in a straight line while you’re aiming, which can mean he veers off-course. So look for targets as early as possible. They are always on the right side of the route.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL"><strong class="Tip-Bold">Targets:</strong> You usually only have one chance to hit a target before you become too close to the target to aim properly, or before Roach veers into a ditch or off a bridge; it’s more important to keep your speed up and ignore a target than to keep aiming at one. If you haven’t struck a target with your second bolt, ignore it and keep going!</p>
<p class="Tip-BL"><strong class="Tip-Bold">Targets:</strong> When hitting a target, look for the timer bar to increase, and the target to rock back and forth slightly (and the objective to update); this is easier than manually peering to see if you struck the target successfully. There is also an indication on the screen that you just hit a target.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL"><strong class="Tip-Bold">Targets:</strong> It isn’t necessary to strike each target or dummy to win this event; so expect to miss around four or five (in total) and still have a chance to win, providing you pass through every checkpoint at a relatively quick speed.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">A proficient Witcher should be able to strike both dummies and hit both targets, then complete the course with around two-thirds left in the “Time remaining” bar.</p>

<p>Move to the open area where a group of knights are practicing their parrying, and Guillaume introduces you to infantry <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>. Each knight has a different method for attacking, and it’s up to you to defend yourself while looking for an opening. Expect to face well-armored foes armed with halberds, or a sword and shield (this depends on which knight you randomly face). Whether you win the fight or not, Guillaume asks afterward if you wish to practice again. You can practice as many times as you wish (subsequent knights have different types of weapons and possibly shields, so you are encouraged to repeat this). Then you can opt to practice for the other two events, or temporarily halt the quest.</p>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>“SLAYING” THE KNIGHTS</h3>
<p class="Tip">This requires you to perform with your steel sword at the height of competence. No <a href="../../training/combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> are to be used—magic gives you an unfair advantage in chivalric battles such as these—and instead you must learn the openings of your opponent. <a href="../../training/combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> are temporarily inaccessible during these bouts; even defensive <a href="../../training/combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> such as Quen.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Certain knights, such as Guy de Bois Fresnes, use a spear in <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>, striking from range. This can easily better you if your timing is off. Learn to block the strikes, dodge, and retaliate when Guy is finishing a strike and is vulnerable.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Other knights, such as Donimir of Troy, opt for a sword and shield, and can be met at a closer range, but can be difficult to penetrate from the front. Dodge or roll around him when he tries to strike, and cut him at his flank. Or push him back and strike after a parry when he’s off-balance. However, if a knight fights with a two-handed sword, striking after parrying might not work, as they will jump back.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Be much more defensive in your posture than normal, as you don’t have <a href="../../training/combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a> to fall back on, and these are no simple bandits you’re facing! However, the timing for blocking and parrying is very similar to those of a toughened bandit.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">You don’t need to worry about dying, just surviving, in the <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> arena. In the main event, expect multiple opponents and a much more chaotic atmosphere. Perfect your blocking, dodging, rolling to strike, and parrying right here.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">If you can’t parry a foe using either a halberd, or a sword and shield, and whittle them down to a victory, you should practice here until you can. That is, if you wish to win this tournament!</p>
