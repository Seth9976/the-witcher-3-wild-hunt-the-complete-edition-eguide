<h3>PLANNING YOUR STAY IN THE FABLESPHERE</h3>
<p class="Tip">Now you’ve emerged from the forest with Syanna and spoken to the “truth-reversing” Joss, there’s some planning to attempt if you want to make the most of your time in the Fablesphere:</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Think of the path from Joss’ tree stump as a long, circular route through the rest of the Fablesphere. You are encouraged to stop and visit every location along the way.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">However, there are a number of optional and hidden activities that must be performed, even including a Contract!</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">It’s worth completing tasks both important and optional before you sow the three magic beans and conjure the beanstalk, so you can see everything and so you can finish optional tasks before leaving this world.</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Once all three beans are found, and the beanstalk summoned, you won’t be able to return to finish any optional tasks; so be aware of this (especially as there’s a <a href="../../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> game to try!).</p>
<p class="Tip-BL">Use your mini-map to pinpoint all the objective <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/carnal-knowledge/locations.html" title="locations">locations</a> you need to visit, but remember there are optional places to explore, too!</p>

<p>This optional task occurs when you first emerge from the toadstool forest. Syanna spies two unicorns that you can ride. You get an objective to get on the white unicorn. This isn’t necessary for quest completion, but it does remind Syanna of her childhood. It reminds you of something definitely more adult!</p>

<h3>WARNING! MAJOR QUEST DECISION AHEAD!</h3>
<p class="Caution"><img class="inline" src="../../../media/bullet_arr_red.png"/> Though you won’t realize it yet, speaking to the Girl with Flint, learning she has a ribbon belonging to Syanna, and then either obtaining (or not obtaining) it, has a major effect during Blood and Wine: Main Quest: <a href="../tesham-mutna/mayhem-at-tesham-mutna.html" title="Tesham Mutna">Tesham Mutna</a>.</p>

<p>In the northwestern part of the Fablesphere is a snowy village, with a Notice Board where a Contract written by a goose can be attempted, and a girl selling a variety of tobacco products. And fisstech! She’s not aware of any magic beans; is that the new name of a kicker she already carries?</p>
<p>Syanna spies the girl is wearing her ribbon, but she’s not about to give it back to her; “<a href="../../secondary-quests/finders-keepers/dipping-your-toes.html" title="finders keepers">finders keepers</a>, sweetheart!” Optionally ask Syanna what the ribbon is about (a family keepsake from her Uncle meant to act as a good luck charm). As the only thing the girl gives out for free is “a first hit,” you’ll have to pay if you want the ribbon back. At this point, you can:</p>
<p><img class="inline" src="../../../media/bullet_arr_red.png"/> (<a href="../../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a>) Play the Girl with Flint at <a href="../../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a>. You have one chance to score a victory in a normal game of cards (she uses the <a href="../../gwent/scoiatael-deck/scoiatael-leader-cards-5.html" title="Scoia’tael deck">Scoia’tael deck</a>). Win and the ribbon is yours. Lose, and it remains with the girl.</p>
<p><img class="inline" src="../../../media/bullet_arr_red.png"/> (500 Crowns) You can pay the Girl with Flint for the ribbon.</p>
<p>(Shop) You can also purchase some narcotics, and other sundry items (usually including a Decoction).</p>
<p>Assuming you win the ribbon, Syanna actually thanks you, and the ribbon is given to her.</p>

<p>Just past the miniature village, between the two humped bridges, are the dwellings of three porcine inhabitants. It seems that two houses (made from straw and wood respectively) have been heavily damaged; possibly by huffing and puffing. Only the brick structure is intact, and even that looks like it’s in a weakened state. When you cast Aard, and destroy the brick house, out come three enraged pigs (treat them like Wild Boars) which must be slain. Then step into the ruins of the pigs’ house, and procure a bean. After showing it to Syanna, she’s shocked that you have a sense of humor. Answer her as you wish; Syanna seems to be softening to your gruff exterior.</p>

<p>Across the marsh in the fields across from the pigs’ houses is a tower you cannot miss; venture close to it and Syanna wonders aloud where Longlocks is; she would grapple up her braid in the past. Now, it doesn’t seem to be there. Furthermore, the tower seems to be in disrepair. Run up the hill to the base of the tower, then leap across to the spiraling platform on the tower itself, where the dead knight in shining <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> lies. Run around, and ascend the wooden scaffolding, and finally a ladder, before leaping into a crack in the main tower. Continue up an interior spiral staircase, then another, all the way to the top of the tower. Longlocks? “Deadlocks” is more apt a description. The girl with the long braid has hanged herself with her own hair, cursed to become a Banshee!</p>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Defeating Longlocks: Her Attacks</h3>
<p class="Tip">Longlocks has the following attacks and maneuvers to be aware of:</p>
<p class="Tip"><a href="../../../media/files/276-357_epilogues_endings_thru_dlc-web-resources/image/020_bawq704fable.jpg"> <img src="../../../media/files/276-357_epilogues_endings_thru_dlc-web-resources/image/020_bawq704fable.jpg"/> </a></p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Banshee Wail:</strong> After taking damage from your attacks, Longlocks will rise to her place of death (the light in the center of the tower ceiling) and let out a scream that could wake the dead; literally. This summons a group of five skeletal foes (and she is invulnerable for a few moments during and after the wail). Longlocks then heals while you’re preoccupied with the skeletons (who are easily dispatched like Bandits, or blown backward with Aard and stabbed while prone).</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Banshee Scream:</strong> Longlocks has a second scream that’s just as ear-piercing, but is used to stun you instead of summon skeletons. Beware of this and dodge or roll away from the sound wave.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Dash Attack:</strong> If you’re stunned, Longlocks bursts forward with great speed and performs a powerful melee attack; don’t let this happen by avoiding the scream in the first place!</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Melee Combo:</strong> Expect some nasty clawing, which can strike you up to four times (usually three or four hits). These are quick and light, and can therefore be parried. She quickly floats backward after each successful attack or counter that she performs.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Counter:</strong> If you’re successful with two or more melee attacks, Longlocks attempts a counter attack; a very quick spin that causes heavy damage, and pushes you (and her) away from each other. You’re encouraged to strike twice before adjusting and striking again, so this is avoided.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Resistances:</strong> The critical effects of <a href="../../training/combat/signs.html" title="Signs">Signs</a>, <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="Bombs">Bombs</a>, and <a href="../../inventory-data/bolts.html" title="bolts">bolts</a> do not affect Longlocks. She is slow, attempting to stay at medium range and away from your attacks; only approaching when attempting a dash or melee combo strike.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Defeating Longlocks: The Best Battle Tactics</h3>
<p class="Tip">Use Yrden to slow Longlocks down enough to dart in with a couple of hard-hitting, spectral oil-coated attacks, and whittle down her health until she starts her infamous wail. As soon as the skeletal foes appear, defeat them as quickly as possible using fast attacks, and knocking them over with Aard; this means Longlocks has fewer opportunity to heal herself, and you can continue this <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> of attrition.</p>
<p class="Tip">Longlocks strafes, tries a melee attack, dashes away, tries the scream to stun you, then uses her dash attack if successful; then she begins this attack pattern again. If wounded, she stops this pattern and summons her bony brethren. When she does, remove the skeletal threats quickly, before attacking her with well-timed sword strikes once again.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Longlocks’ Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p class="Tip"><a href="../../../media/files/276-357_epilogues_endings_thru_dlc-web-resources/image/93648.jpg"> <img src="../../../media/files/276-357_epilogues_endings_thru_dlc-web-resources/image/93648.jpg"/> </a></p>
</aside>
<p>After the battle with Longlocks, procure the bean from the tower, and retrace your steps. Carefully. Alternatively, you can step out onto the balcony of the tower and jump into the water. Before leaving, you can grab a bite from the Wishing Table in Longlock’s room. The food on it replenishes after a few seconds. Back at Syanna, the conversation turns to Dettlaff. Ask any questions you wish, as Syanna can describe her first meeting with the vampire. Your answers are important here. Show enough compassion and Syanna is more likely to show her sister that same compassion later on.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of the forest (if you follow the path toward the edge of the woods from where you spoke to joshing Joss), is a blocked-off cave opening and an embankment where three bears are snoozing in their beds. It seems the girl with the golden locks (slumped against the table) may have accidentally woken these godless killing machines. Inspect the table, and you’ll see three bowls of porridge. Take any of them, and all three bears wake up, not happy with your attempt at breakfast pilfering. Defeat all three bears in <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a>. Then leave; there’s no magic bean here.</p>

<p>Search the woods for grandmother’s house, a quaint dwelling with an outbuilding and well. The main dwelling is of most interest; enter to discover a Big Bad Wolf sleeping off the effects of a night’s drinking with Redbeard. Optionally you can offer to have a drink with the fellow, but the Wolf is uninterested, before broaching the subject of magic beans. The Wolf seems to know about a bean, but he wants to reenact his fairy tale one last time. The only slight problem? The Wolf has murdered <a href="../../secondary-quests/little-red/slaughter-amongst-the-sunflowers.html" title="Little Red">Little Red</a> Riding Hood, as payback for all the times his gut was cut open, filled full of rocks, and drowned. Both Hood and the Hunter are slowly decomposing at the bottom of a well.</p>

<p>Syanna has the idea of dressing up as <a href="../../secondary-quests/little-red/slaughter-amongst-the-sunflowers.html" title="Little Red">Little Red</a> Riding Hood. Finding the attire is simple enough; jump into the well in the grounds of grandmother’s house, dive down to the investigation area, and use your Witcher Senses to locate the remains of Hood and the Hunter. Remove the Red Riding Hood from the corpse, then swim along the underwater tunnel, surfacing in the pond around the tower.</p>

<p>You hand the outfit to Syanna, who asks how she looks. Answer as you wish before returning to the Big Bad Wolf. You inform him that Syanna is playing the role of the granddaughter, while you’re the fetching hunter. After Syanna reacts in mock shock at her “grandmother’s” big eyes, arms, and mouth, the wolf takes a lunge at you. Prepare to battle the Big Bad Wolf, using all the techniques you developed when fighting Werewolves. Syanna also helps give grandmother a good send off. After the battle, you cut the wolf’s belly open, and procure the red bean.</p>

<p>Afterward, Syanna seems taken aback that you haven’t asked her what happened after she was cast out of the first family of Beauclair. Inquire in whatever way you wish. Once again, showing sufficient compassion will push Syanna toward showing compassion to the Duchess later on.</p>

<p>Just before you reach the bridge and visit the three little pigs’ houses, assuming you’re moving counterclockwise from the winter village, on your right (northwest) side is a strange little hamlet; with emphasis on the word “little”. A tiny cluster of houses and a windmill have but a single inhabitant. Be careful where you tread, as you can easily step on the single, miniscule inhabitant of the village, incurring the wrath of Syanna.</p>

<p>Between the village where the Little Flint Girl is, and Thumbelina’s village, is a large rainbow arc. Head through the trees to a short path leading to a pot of gold! Beware if you’re intending on gathering any valuables from this pot; if you step too closely, the pot changes into a golden panther with an unfriendly disposition.</p>

<p>Move to the smaller ponds between Joss’ location, and Longlocks’ tower, and chance upon a glowing will o’ the wisp. Despite Syanna’s warnings, you can follow this orb to another marshy pond area, where the corpse of a knight errant can be found. His relic <a href="../../inventory-data/armor/armor.html" title="armor">armor</a> and steel sword are easily pilfered, though it can only be worn in the Fablesphere.</p>

<p>Over on the shore of the lake, close to the bridge near the goose’s house, you discover the rotting form of the Wawel dragon. While you and Syanna discuss the origins of this fairy tale, you cut the belly open, and unsuccessfully attempt to locate any beans.</p>

<p>Venture “under the bridge” close to the goose’s house, and you can discover a strange vegetable. Though red in color, it isn’t a bean, but rather a pepper.</p>

<p>Close to grandmother’s house, on a rocky outcrop overlooking the tower at the edge of the woods, is a most peculiar scene; a <a href="../../inventory-data/horse.html" title="horse">horse</a> with a dog standing on top of it, then a cat atop the dog, and a hen atop them all. Get too close, lob a bomb, or attempt some crossbow aiming, and face an admonishment from Syanna. No matter; there’s no bean here.</p>
