<h3>QUESTING DECISIONS</h3>
<p class="Note">This quest is accessible immediately once you have completed either (but not both) of the following Main Quests:</p>
<p class="Note"><img class="inline" src="../../../media/bullet_arr_red.png"/> Main Quest: Beyond Hill and Dale…: You conclude the search for Syanna, and she arrives with you and Regis to meet Dettlaff.</p>
<p class="Note"><img class="inline" src="../../../media/bullet_arr_red.png"/> Main Quest: <a href="../what-lies-unseen/path-to-the-unseenan-audience-with-the-unseen.html" title="What Lies Unseen">What Lies Unseen</a>: You conclude your talk with the Unseen Elder, and you and Regis head to the place where Dettlaff is to be summoned.</p>
<p class="Note">Either choice has a major effect regarding how this quest concludes.</p>
</aside>
<figure class="full"><a href="../../../media/files/276-357_epilogues_endings_thru_dlc-web-resources/image/BAWQ705_001.jpg"> <img src="../../../media/files/276-357_epilogues_endings_thru_dlc-web-resources/image/BAWQ705_001.jpg"/> </a></figure>
<h3>WITH SYANNA: A RIBBON OF RED</h3>
<p><img class="inline" src="../../../media/bullet_arr_red.png"/> Some time later, both you and Regis reach Tesham Mutna; the old fortification where Dettlaff has agreed to meet. If Syanna is with you, after staring at the view for a moment, Syanna seems unimpressed with this pile of stones. Optionally ask her if she’s nervous to see Dettlaff again. But you’re here to tell Syanna to be ready; Dettlaff will arrive at any moment. A few moments later, Dettlaff appears.</p>
<figure class="full"><a href="../../../media/files/276-357_epilogues_endings_thru_dlc-web-resources/image/BAWQ705_005.jpg"> <img src="../../../media/files/276-357_epilogues_endings_thru_dlc-web-resources/image/BAWQ705_005.jpg"/> </a></figure>
<p>Dettlaff has little time for past affection with his ex-lover, and he launches into her with a vicious attack:</p>
<p><img class="inline" src="../../../media/bullet_arr_red.png"/>If, during Main Quest: Beyond Hill and Dale…, you won (or paid for) the ribbon for Syanna, from the Girl with the Flint, the attack doesn’t kill her, and she vanishes, appearing back in the Fablesphere. It seems her Uncle’s talisman was imbued with some luck after all.</p>
<p><img class="inline" src="../../../media/bullet_arr_red.png"/> If, during Main Quest: Beyond Hill and Dale…, you lost a game of <a href="../../gwent/gwent-overview.html" title="Gwent">Gwent</a> against the Girl with the Flint, or ignored the Girl altogether, and didn’t obtain Syanna’s ribbon, the attack ends in Syanna’s life being snuffed out, within the cursed walls of Tesham Mutna.</p>
<p>If Dettlaff killed Syanna he is ready to depart, he got what he came for. You can choose to fight him, or let him go. In all other outcomes <a href="../../training/combat/overview.html" title="combat">combat</a> is imminent.</p>
<h3>WITHOUT SYANNA: SUMMONED TO SLAUGHTER</h3>
<p><img class="inline" src="../../../media/bullet_arr_red.png"/> Some time later, both you and Regis reach Tesham Mutna; the old fortification where Dettlaff is to be summoned. After staring at the view for a moment, you can converse with Regis. Optionally ask him if he’s angry you didn’t free Syanna. But you’re here to request Regis inform the Elder that you’re ready for Dettlaff to be summoned. Regis whispers to one of his ravens, and it flies away.</p>
<p>From the depths of the Unseen Elder’s cave, the bats carry a message that pauses the <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/bestiary/vampires.html" title="vampires">vampires</a> attacking Beauclair in their tracks. Carried on the wind, the order is given, and Dettlaff cannot refuse.</p>
<p>A highly-annoyed Dettlaff appears at Tesham Mutna, demanding to know why he was summoned. You can answer how you wish (that you’re here to kill him, or demand the attacks on the city are stopped). Either answer begins Dettlaff’s transformation into his vampiric form. The battle is on!</p>

<p>Dettlaff’s charge against you is thwarted by Regis, who takes the form of a vampire and dislocates Dettlaff’s shoulder in the process. Popping the socket back into place, the two <a href="../../appendices-and-compendiums/bestiary/vampires.html" title="vampires">vampires</a> hiss, before launching a flurry of claws and leaps across the ruined plateau. When you are able, stop for a moment. This is a critical moment to fully prepare for the fight of your life! Have you swigged your Black Blood, coated your sword in Vampire Oil, and understood the few weaknesses that the Higher Vampire Dettlaff possesses? Only then, should you rush forward.</p>

<p>Amid the tumbling and lashes, both you and Regis manage to subdue Dettlaff, but Regis stops you ending the fight with a killing blow. This proves to be a costly mistake, as Dettlaff blinks out of existence, appearing again to thrust his claws through Regis’ back. Throttled and thrown against the battlements like a ragdoll, Regis seems in no state to aid you. The fight against Detllaff now begins in earnest!</p>
<h3>STAGE 1: VAMPIRE FORM</h3>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Defeating Dettlaff the Vampire: Dettlaff’s Attacks</h3>
<p class="Tip">Dettlaff exhibits the same level of initial ferocity that he did during your first encounter with him, during Main Quest: <a href="../blood-run/the-beast-is-unleashed.html" title="Blood Run">Blood Run</a>. Therefore, similar tactics apply:</p>
<p class="Tip">Dettlaff is inhumanely fast, and you should remain extremely cautious when fighting this Higher vampire. With super-human speed and strength, he uses fog to literally disappear, and dash out of to claw with almost unmatched ferocity. This mist is also how he quickly changes position; almost faster than you can blink!</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Light Attack (Melee):</strong> Expect a light attack with his talons; there are three variations of this, and all are best parried.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Strong Attack (Melee):</strong> Watch for a slightly slower, more pronounced strike with his talons. There are three variations of this, and all should be parried, or better yet, countered so you can quickly deal damage back to him.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Combination Attack (Melee):</strong> Expect a combination of three to five connected strikes, with two variations; usually from the flank, from behind, and appearing from the mist. You have little time to react, so continuously parry. Failing that, roll or dodge just before the first strike connects.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Short Dash Attack (Special):</strong> Watch for a fast dash attack, a brief transformation into mist, finishing with a second fast dash attack. Don’t be coaxed into attacking after the first hit; you’ll slice through mist and miss him. Remain on the defensive.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Dash Attack (Special):</strong> A variation on the short dash finishes with a short stop before a strong slashing attack. This is a good place to retaliate; countering the strong final strike with one (or two) of your own. But don’t get greedy; he flees from your strikes with ease!</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Strong Uppercut Attack (Melee):</strong> Expect a strong attack with a flourish that can stagger you, leaving him moments to regenerate, thus prolonging this battle and leaving you vulnerable. Blocking the strong attack is good; countering is preferable.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Resistances:</strong> Dettlaff is resistant to poison, bleeding, and Yrden, so employing any of these in battle is simply a waste of time.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Defeating The Vampire Form: The Best Battle Tactics</h3>
<p class="Tip">Staying patient and cool under the extreme speed and savagery exhibited by Dettlaff’s Vampire Form is key to surviving this fight. Counter any of Dettlaff’s attacks, and wait until he attempts his stronger strikes. If you can counter them, you have a tiny window of opportunity to land a couple of strikes before the Beast vanishes or warps behind you to strike.</p>
<p class="Tip"><a href="../../../media/files/276-357_epilogues_endings_thru_dlc-web-resources/image/BAWQ705_011.jpg"> <img src="../../../media/files/276-357_epilogues_endings_thru_dlc-web-resources/image/BAWQ705_011.jpg"/> </a></p>
<p class="Tip">Dettlaff is adept at parrying; he blocks all attacks from the front, and after three parries (or hits), he usually teleports behind you and counters. If you manage to strike him in the back, he dashes away, so as not to receive further punishment from you. Not only that, but he can regenerate up to 30 percent of his essence, usually while standing at range.</p>
<p class="Tip">Judicious use of Quen helps, not only to shield you but to shrug off any attacks you aren’t quick enough to parry while you learn the timing to thwart this foe. Swig Black Blood to ensure any damage Dettlaff causes is partly reflected back at him, coat your silver sword in Vampire Oil to ensure each strike damages him as much as possible, and then fight back only after he finishes his strong attack. The battle may take a while, but it’s the best way to remain in one piece and stop this higher vampire, if only temporarily….</p>

<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Defeating Dettlaff’s True Form: Dettlaff’s Attacks</h3>
<p class="Tip">When you’ve removed around a quarter of Dettlaff’s vitality, a grotesque transformation takes place, as Dettlaff reveal his true form! This fearsome flying enemy is essentially immortal, and so fights with no regard to his personal safety, and with a ferocity not previous encountered! When in the air, he is impervious to any attack. In addition, watch for the following offensive maneuvers:</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Flight and Flying Dash:</strong> While airborne, he isn’t able to be harmed, though he sometimes executes a Flying Dash, striking you before he flies away again. It is during this attack that you can make a well-timed sword strike, interrupting the dash and bring Dettlaff to the ground; one of only two opportunities to strike him.</p>
<p class="Tip"><a href="../../../media/files/276-357_epilogues_endings_thru_dlc-web-resources/image/BAWQ705_013.jpg"> <img src="../../../media/files/276-357_epilogues_endings_thru_dlc-web-resources/image/BAWQ705_013.jpg"/> </a></p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Teleport:</strong> He is able to teleport short distances; so keep an eye on where he is at all times so you aren’t slaughtered from the flanks or rear.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Dive Attack:</strong> Using his massive wings to raise himself up and out of your reach, he flaps up, then brings himself down with a mighty pummeling ground strike that can hit hard and possibly stagger. However, he requires some time to recover from this dive, and is vulnerable on the ground.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Swarm Attack:</strong> Dettlaff conjures a massive swarm of bats, damaging and staggering you. Back away, and dodge or roll quickly to avoid this.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Traps:</strong> After Dettlaff recovers from an attack, he conjures a revolting, oil-like trap that can severely impede your <a href="../../training/movement.html" title="movement">movement</a>. He uses a special Dive Attack to hammer you while you’re prone, so avoid the Traps whenever possible by remaining mobile, and don’t get too greedy when striking Dettlaff during his recovery.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Resistances:</strong> Dettlaff’s True Form is immune to burning (Igni and weapons), stuns, blinding, and Axii. If he’s flying, he dodges any <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> or crossbow <a href="../../inventory-data/bolts.html" title="bolts">bolts</a> you may try to strike him with. When he’s recovering from a strike, he can send you flying backward, knocking you over; so get in with strikes and retreat quickly.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Defeating Dettlaff: The Best Battle Tactics</h3>
<p class="Tip">Put your projectiles away when Dettlaff is airborne, as you cannot harm him when</p>
<p class="Tip">he’s flying. The only times he is susceptible to harm is at the end of his Dive Attack (he lands on the ground, and is vulnerable for a moment), and during the Flying Dash (where this attack can be interrupted, and Dettlaff brought to the ground). Swords are best employed here, though <a href="../../inventory-data/bombs.html" title="bombs">bombs</a> work too. Then whittle Dettlaff’s health down with two or three strikes before backing away, out of the range of the trap he conjures, and let him fly away. Then begin the tactic anew.</p>
</aside>
<h3>STAGE 3: BLOOD CONSTRUCT (FINAL FORM)</h3>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Defeating Dettlaff’s Final Form: Dettlaff’s Attacks</h3>
<p class="Tip">At around one third vitality, after successfully clipping Dettlaff’s wings, this horror wraps himself up completely in a revolting cocoon of blood. Quickly sculpting an encased arena from gore and flesh, It is supported by three vein columns that pump blood into the cocoon hanging from the middle of this atrocity. A doppleganger of Dettlaff is also conjured, made from the blood and sent to fight in Dettlaff’s stead.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>An Idiot Construct:</strong> The Blood Construct is a magical being formed from the blood and willpower of Dettlaff. It does not possess any intelligence of its own, and exists only to kill you. So expect a constant barrage of attacks with little time to rest.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Melee Strike (one hit, six variations):</strong> A quick single attack that is damaging, and can be parried or dodged. You can retaliate afterward, but as the construct shouldn’t be the focus of your fighting (aside from getting rid of it momentarily), think of all these attacks as a hindrance to your main goal.</p>
<p class="Tip"><a href="../../../media/files/276-357_epilogues_endings_thru_dlc-web-resources/image/BAWQ705_016.jpg"> <img src="../../../media/files/276-357_epilogues_endings_thru_dlc-web-resources/image/BAWQ705_016.jpg"/> </a></p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Combo Strike (four variations):</strong> A series of attacks, inflicting damage up to four times in a single combination. These can be parried or dodged.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Dash Attack:</strong> A sliding strike that can be interrupted or countered, allowing you to stun the construct for a few moments; only of the best ways to quickly remove yourself from its clutches to deal with the real solution to your problem.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Flying Attack:</strong> Similar to the attack Dettlaff attempted during Phase two of this battle, this occurs once the Construct is dispelled (by your attacks), only to reappear again. Dodge away from its landing spot, or take a chance at hitting it to remove a small amount of its health.</p>
<p class="Tip"><strong>Resistances:</strong> The construct is immune to any critical attacks, and can easily parry your sword strikes. It also revives itself each time you kill it, making it effectively immortal.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="Tip">
<h3>Defeating the Flesh Arena: The Best Battle Tactics</h3>
<p class="Tip"><a href="../../../media/files/276-357_epilogues_endings_thru_dlc-web-resources/image/BAWQ705_015.jpg"> <img src="../../../media/files/276-357_epilogues_endings_thru_dlc-web-resources/image/BAWQ705_015.jpg"/> </a></p>
<p class="Tip">The three columns, resembling veins, are the main focus of your attack. Make sure you are slicing, blasting, or bombing these stationary targets as quickly and as often as possible. Waylay the Blood Construct by using Yrden, quick maneuvering around the flesh arena, and ranged attacks at the flesh columns so you don’t need to physically move to each one. Treat the Blood Construct as you would Dettlaff in Phase one of this battle, but know that you can never defeat this golem; though removing it temporarily before it reforms allows a few seconds of uninterrupted flesh-column removal! When all three flesh columns are removed, Dettlaff finally yields.</p>
</aside>
<p>The battle is over at last. Regis insists that the still-thrashing form of Dettlaff is dismissed in a style of his own choosing. Against the howling maelstrom, the Beast of Beauclair is removed from existence.</p>
<p>Two weeks then pass, as your previous decisions and actions catch up with you.</p>
